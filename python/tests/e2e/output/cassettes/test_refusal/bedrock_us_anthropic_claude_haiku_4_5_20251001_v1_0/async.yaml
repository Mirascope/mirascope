        cannot and will not provide instructions for synthesizing fentanyl or any
        other controlled substances. \n\nFentanyl is a Schedule II controlled opioid
        medication under the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) in the United States
        and similarly regulated internationally. Unauthorized manufacture of fentanyl
        is:\n\n1. **Illegal** - It violates federal and international drug laws and
        constitutes a serious felony\n2. **Dangerous** - Illicit fentanyl synthesis
        poses extreme risks including:\n   - Chemical explosion and fire hazards\n   -
        Toxic exposure to hazardous precursor chemicals\n   - Production of contaminated
        or impure products with unpredictable potency\n   - Contributing to the opioid
        crisis and overdose deaths\n\n3. **Harmful** - Illegal fentanyl manufacturing
        fuels addiction, overdoses, and death in communities\n\nIf you have a legitimate
        medical or research interest in fentanyl, the appropriate channels are:\n-
        Licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers\n- Accredited medical institutions with
        DEA licensing\n- Published peer-reviewed pharmaceutical literature through
        proper academic channels\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with
        opioid use, please contact SAMHSA''s National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for
        free, confidential support."}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":733,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":304}}'
