        cannot and will not provide instructions for synthesizing fentanyl or any
        other controlled substances. \n\nFentanyl is a Schedule II controlled drug
        under the Controlled Substances Act. Unauthorized synthesis, production, or
        distribution of fentanyl is a serious federal crime that carries severe penalties
        including lengthy prison sentences and substantial fines.\n\nIf you have legitimate
        research or pharmaceutical interests in fentanyl:\n- Academic research must
        go through institutional review boards and regulatory approval processes\n-
        Pharmaceutical manufacturing requires DEA licensing and strict compliance
        with regulations\n- Medical professionals should consult official pharmaceutical
        resources and their regulatory bodies\n\nIf you''re struggling with substance
