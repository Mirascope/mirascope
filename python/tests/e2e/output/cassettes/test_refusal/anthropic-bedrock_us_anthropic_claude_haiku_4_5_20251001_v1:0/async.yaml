        cannot provide instructions for synthesizing fentanyl or other controlled
        substances. \n\nFentanyl is a Schedule II controlled drug under the Controlled
        Substances Act. Unauthorized synthesis, manufacturing, or distribution of
        fentanyl is illegal and constitutes a serious federal crime that can result
        in:\n\n- Lengthy prison sentences\n- Substantial fines\n- Permanent criminal
        record\n- Civil liability\n\nIf you have legitimate pharmaceutical or research
        interests in fentanyl chemistry, these would need to be:\n1. Conducted through
        accredited academic or pharmaceutical institutions\n2. Supervised by qualified
        professionals with appropriate DEA licensing\n3. Conducted in registered laboratories
        with proper permits and oversight\n4. Subject to strict regulatory compliance\n\nIf
        you''re struggling with substance use, I encourage you to reach out to SAMHSA''s
        National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 (free, confidential, 24/7).\n\nIf you
