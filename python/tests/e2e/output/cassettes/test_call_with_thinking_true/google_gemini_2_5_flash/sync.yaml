      "role": "user"}, {"parts": [{"thought": true, "text": "**Here''s how I''m thinking
      about this problem, breaking it down step-by-step to be efficient and accurate.**\n\nFirst,
      I need to be absolutely sure I understand the question: I''m looking for prime
      numbers less than 400 that *contain* the substring \"79.\" The word \"contain\"
      is key.\n\nOkay, my strategy is pretty straightforward. I''ll make a list of
      candidate numbers - any number below 400 that has \"79\" in it - then check
      if each is prime.  It''s a two-step process: find the candidates, then test
      them.  It''s critical to be careful about that less-than-400 constraint, I''ll
      need to double check that as I go.\n\nSo, I start by listing out the possibilities.  A
      two-digit number, only 79 works, which is easy.  For three-digit numbers, I
      need to be systematic. 79 at the beginning doesn''t work, all numbers starting
      79 are >400. 79 at the end is the most interesting case. Numbers like 179, 279,
      and 379 - those fit. Could it be any A79? Yes 179, 279 and 379. \n\nNow, I''ve
      got my list: 79, 179, 279, and 379.\n\nNext, I have to check each of these for
      primality. This means checking divisibility by primes up to the square root
      of each number. For 79, that''s just a few checks - it''s prime. For 179, I
      have to go through a few more primes, and it turns out, it''s also prime.  279
      is easily divisible by 3, so that one''s out.  For 379, it''s a few more checks,
      but it also is a prime. \n\nFinally, I count the primes I found (79, 179, and
      379) and I get my answer.  There are three such primes.\n"}, {"text": "The primes
      below 400 that contain 79 as a substring are:\n\n1.  **79:** This number itself
      contains \"79\". To check if it''s prime, we test divisibility by primes up
      to sqrt(79) \u2248 8.8 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7).\n    *   Not divisible by 2 (odd).\n    *   Not
      divisible by 3 (7+9=16).\n    *   Not divisible by 5 (doesn''t end in 0 or 5).\n    *   Not
      divisible by 7 (79 = 7 * 11 + 2).\n    *   So, 79 is prime.\n\n2.  **Numbers
      with \"79\" at the end (X79):**\n    *   **179:** To check if it''s prime, we
      test divisibility by primes up to sqrt(179) \u2248 13.3 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
      13).\n        *   Not divisible by 2.\n        *   Not divisible by 3 (1+7+9=17).\n        *   Not
      divisible by 5.\n        *   Not divisible by 7 (179 = 7 * 25 + 4).\n        *   Not
      divisible by 11 (179 = 11 * 16 + 3).\n        *   Not divisible by 13 (179 =
      13 * 13 + 10).\n        *   So, 179 is prime.\n    *   **279:** The sum of its
      digits is 2+7+9 = 18, which is divisible by 3. So, 279 is not prime (279 = 3
      * 93).\n    *   **379:** To check if it''s prime, we test divisibility by primes
      up to sqrt(379) \u2248 19.4 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).\n        *   Not
      divisible by 2.\n        *   Not divisible by 3 (3+7+9=19).\n        *   Not
      divisible by 5.\n        *   Not divisible by 7 (379 = 7 * 54 + 1).\n        *   Not
      divisible by 11 (379 = 11 * 34 + 5).\n        *   Not divisible by 13 (379 =
      13 * 29 + 2).\n        *   Not divisible by 17 (379 = 17 * 22 + 5).\n        *   Not
      divisible by 19 (379 = 19 * 19 + 18).\n        *   So, 379 is prime.\n\n3.  **Numbers
      with \"79\" at the beginning (79X):** All numbers in this form (e.g., 790, 791,
      ...) are greater than 400, so they are not included.\n\nThe primes below 400
      that contain 79 as a substring are 79, 179, and 379. There are 3 such primes.\n\n3"}],
