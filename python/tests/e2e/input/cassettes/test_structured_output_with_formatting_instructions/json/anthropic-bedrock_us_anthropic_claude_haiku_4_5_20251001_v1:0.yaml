        follows Kvothe, a legendary figure, as he recounts his extraordinary life
        story. The prose is beautifully written, the magic system is creative and
        well-developed, and the world-building is immersive. It''s the first book
        in *The Kingkiller Chronicle* series and is perfect if you enjoy character-driven
        narratives with mystery and adventure."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":67,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":135}}'
