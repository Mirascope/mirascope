    "# Step-back Prompting: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with High-Level Questions\n",

    "This recipe demonstrates how to implement the Step-back prompting technique using Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mirascope. Step-back prompting is a method that enhances an LLM's reasoning capabilities by asking a high-level question about relevant concepts or facts before addressing the original query.\n",

    "<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06117\">Step-back</a> prompting is an alternative to the Chain of Thought technique, where one asks the LLM a high-level question about relevant concepts or facts before asking it the actual question. This technique is derived from the fact that humans often take step backs and use abstractions to arrive at an answer, and it can yield correct answers at times when Chain of Thought fails.</p>\n",

He signed a four-year, $215 million contract extension with the Golden State Warriors, which was the largest contract in NBA history at that time. This contract significantly boosted his earnings, making him the top earner in the league for that season. Other players like LeBron James and Kevin Durant were also among the highest-paid, but Curry's contract set a new benchmark in player salaries at that time.\n"

    "This implementation consists of three main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `get_stepback_question`: This function takes a query and generates a more generic, step-back version of the question.\n",
    "2. `call`: A standard call to OpenAI that processes the step-back question.\n",
    "3. `stepback`: This function orchestrates the Step-back prompting technique. It first calls `get_stepback_question` to generate a high-level question, then uses `call` to get a response to this question, and finally combines this information to answer the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Step-back prompting implementation offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved reasoning about complex queries by considering higher-level concepts first.\n",
    "2. Potential for more accurate responses in tasks that benefit from broader context.\n",
    "3. Ability to overcome limitations of other techniques like Chain of Thought in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing this technique, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balancing the generality of the step-back question with its relevance to the original query.\n",
    "- Experimenting with different numbers of few-shot examples to optimize performance.\n",
    "- Adjusting the prompt for generating step-back questions based on your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",

    "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Additional Real-World Applications</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Complex Problem Solving</b>: Use Step-back prompting for multi-step problems in fields like mathematics or engineering.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Medical Diagnosis</b>: Apply the technique to consider general symptoms before focusing on specific conditions.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Legal Analysis</b>: Implement Step-back prompting to first consider broader legal principles before addressing specific cases.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Historical Analysis</b>: Use the method to first consider broader historical context before analyzing specific events.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Product Development</b>: Apply Step-back prompting to consider general market trends before focusing on specific product features.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When adapting this recipe to your specific use-case, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tailoring the few-shot examples to your domain for better performance.\n",
    "- Implementing a feedback loop to continuously improve the quality of step-back questions generated.\n",
    "- Combining Step-back prompting with other techniques like Self-consistency for even more robust reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- Experimenting with different LLM models to find the best balance between performance and efficiency for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Mirascope's `call` decorator and dynamic configuration, you can easily implement and customize the Step-back prompting technique to enhance your LLM's reasoning capabilities across a wide range of applications."
