    "This implementation consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `break_into_subproblems`: This function takes a query and breaks it down into subproblems using few-shot examples.\n",
    "2. `call`: A simple function that makes a call to the LLM with the given message history.\n",
    "3. `least_to_most`: This function orchestrates the Least to Most technique. It first breaks the problem into subproblems, then solves each subproblem sequentially, appending the results to the message history.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Least to Most implementation offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved reasoning for complex problems by breaking them down into manageable steps.\n",
    "2. Enhanced ability to handle multi-step arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks.\n",
    "3. Potential for more accurate responses by solving subproblems individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing this technique, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carefully crafting few-shot examples to guide the problem decomposition process.\n",
    "- Balancing the number of subproblems to avoid oversimplification or overcomplexity.\n",
    "- Ensuring that the query context and question are clear and contain all necessary information.\n",

    "When adapting this recipe to your specific use-case, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tailoring the few-shot examples to your domain for better problem decomposition.\n",
    "- Implementing a mechanism to handle interdependent subproblems.\n",
    "- Combining Least to Most with other techniques like Self-Consistency for even more robust reasoning.\n",
    "- Developing a feedback loop to refine the problem decomposition process based on the accuracy of final answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Mirascope's `call` decorator, response models, and dynamic configuration, you can easily implement and customize the Least to Most technique to enhance your LLM's ability to reason about complex problems across a wide range of applications."
