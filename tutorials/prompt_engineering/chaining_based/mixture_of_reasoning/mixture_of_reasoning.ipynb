    "# Mixture of Reasoning: Enhancing LLM Performance with Multiple Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixture of Reasoning is a prompt engineering technique where you set up multiple calls, each utilizing a different prompt engineering technique. This approach is best when you want to be able to handle a wide variety of responses, or have a variety of techniques that you have found to be successful for responding to a type of prompt.\n",

    "In the <a href=\"https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/docs/2023_findings_more.pdf\">original paper</a>, a trained classifier is used to determine the best answer, but since we do not have access to that, we will use an LLM to evaluate the best answer instead. To get a clean separation between the reasoning and the actual output, we'll use <code>response_model</code> in our final evaluation call.\n",

    "This implementation consists of several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Three different prompt engineering techniques:\n",
    "   - `cot_call`: [Chain of Thought reasoning](../../text_based/chain_of_thought)\n",
    "   - `emotion_prompting_call`: [Emotion prompting](../../text_based/emotion_prompting)\n",
    "   - `rar_call`: [Rephrase and Respond](../../text_based/rephrase_and_respond)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A `BestResponse` model to structure the output of the final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `mixture_of_reasoning` function, which:\n",
    "   - Calls each of the three prompt engineering techniques\n",
    "   - Uses dynamic configuration to pass the responses to the final evaluation\n",
    "   - Returns the best response and reasoning using the `BestResponse` model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mixture of Reasoning implementation offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved ability to handle a wide variety of queries by leveraging multiple prompt engineering techniques.\n",
    "2. Enhanced performance by selecting the best response from multiple approaches.\n",
    "3. Flexibility to add or modify prompt engineering techniques as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing this technique, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carefully selecting the prompt engineering techniques to include based on your specific use case.\n",
    "- Balancing the number of techniques with computational cost and time constraints.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning the evaluation criteria in the final step to best suit your needs.\n",
