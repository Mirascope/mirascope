    "Reverse chain of thought is a prompt engineering technique where a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">chain of thought</a> call is made for a query, then we attempt to reconstruct the query from the attempted solution. Both the original and reconstructed query are broken down into their individual conditions, and each condition is cross-referenced with the totality of conditions for the other query to determine the existence of overlooked facts or hallucinations. The questions themselves are also compared to ensure that the two queries not only share the context but also ask the same question. This fine-grained comparison is used in a final prompt.\n",
