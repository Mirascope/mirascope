# Reverse Chain of Thought: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Self-Reflection

This recipe demonstrates how to implement the Reverse Chain of Thought technique using Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mirascope. Reverse Chain of Thought is a prompt engineering method that enhances an LLM's reasoning capabilities by encouraging it to reflect on and correct its own thought process.

<p class="admonition-title">Background</p>
<p>
Reverse chain of thought is a prompt engineering technique where a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">chain of thought</a> call is made for a query, then we attempt to reconstruct the query from the attempted solution. Both the original and reconstructed query are broken down into their individual conditions, and each condition is cross-referenced with the totality of conditions for the other query to determine the existence of overlooked facts or hallucinations. The questions themselves are also compared to ensure that the two queries not only share the context but also ask the same question. This fine-grained comparison is used in a final prompt.
</p>
<p>
In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11499">original paper</a>, no prompt was given for the case when mistakes do not exist, so we took the liberty of asking the model to repeat a solution without mistakes. 
</p>
<p>
Reverse chain of thought is a technique that works for any prompt which has shown signs of susceptibility to hallucinations or misinterpretations in its initial attempts to answer the question.

```

    Thank you for your feedback! Based on your clarifications, hereâ€™s a revised problem prompt that corresponds to your original question while considering all the necessary conditions:
    
    ---
    
    **Problem Prompt:**
    
    At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, there are 90 participants who need to be divided into groups for the event to start. Each group consists of 9 people. If \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups formed contributed by bringing back seashells, and each member of those groups brought back 2 seashells each, how many seashells were brought back in total?
    
    ---
    
    This prompt encapsulates all essential components of the problem. It clarifies the number of participants, how they are grouped, the fraction of groups contributing, and the number of seashells collected by each member, leading to the final calculation. Let's go through the reasoning for clarity:
    
    1. **Total Participants**: 90 people.
    2. **Groups Formed**: Each group has 9 members, so:
       \[
       \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
       \]
    3. **Groups Contributing Shells**: \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total groups contributed:
       \[
       \text{Groups contributing} = 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6
       \]
    4. **Total Members in Contributing Groups**: Each contributing group has 9 members:
       \[
       \text{Total members contributing} = 6 \times 9 = 54
       \]
    5. **Total Seashells Collected**: Each member brought back 2 seashells:
       \[
       \text{Total seashells} = 54 \times 2 = 108
       \]
    
    Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:
    
    \[
    \boxed{108}
    \] 
    
    This approach correctly follows the sequence of logical deductions based on the problem's premise. Thank you for your guidance!


This implementation consists of several key functions:

1. `zero_shot_cot`: Generates an initial chain of thought response.
2. `reconstruct_query`: Attempts to reconstruct the original query from the chain of thought response.
3. `decompose_query`: Breaks down a query into its individual conditions.
4. `compare_conditions`: Compares individual conditions to determine if they are deducible from a list of other conditions.
5. `compare_questions`: Checks if two questions are asking the same thing.
6. `fine_grained_comparison`: Performs a detailed comparison between the original and reconstructed queries, identifying overlooked conditions, hallucinations, and misinterpretations.
7. `reverse_cot`: Orchestrates the entire Reverse Chain of Thought process.

## Benefits and Considerations

The Reverse Chain of Thought implementation offers several advantages:

1. Improved accuracy by identifying and correcting overlooked conditions, hallucinations, and misinterpretations.
2. Enhanced reasoning capabilities through self-reflection and error correction.
3. More robust problem-solving, especially for complex or ambiguous queries.

When implementing this technique, consider:

- Balancing the computational cost of multiple LLM calls with the improved accuracy.
- Fine-tuning the prompts for each step to optimize the reflection and correction process.
- Adapting the technique for different types of problems or domains.
