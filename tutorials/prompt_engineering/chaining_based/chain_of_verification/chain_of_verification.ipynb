    "# Chain of Verification: Enhancing LLM Accuracy through Self-Verification\n",

    "This recipe demonstrates how to implement the Chain of Verification technique using Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mirascope. Chain of Verification is a prompt engineering method that enhances an LLM's accuracy by generating and answering verification questions based on its initial response.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11495\">Chain of Verification</a> is a prompt engineering technique where one takes a prompt and its initial LLM response then generates a checklist of questions that can be used to verify the initial answer. Each of these questions are then answered individually with separate LLM calls, and the results of each verification question are used to edit the final answer. LLMs are often more truthful when asked to verify a particular fact rather than use it in their own answer, so this technique is effective in reducing hallucinations.\n",

    "The Chain of Verification implementation offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved accuracy by systematically verifying initial responses.\n",
    "2. Reduction of hallucinations and factual errors in LLM outputs.\n",
    "3. Transparent fact-checking process that can be easily audited.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing this technique, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balancing the number of verification questions with response time and computational cost.\n",
    "- Tailoring the verification question generation process to your specific use case.\n",
    "- Implementing error handling for cases where verification reveals significant discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "When adapting this recipe to your specific use-case, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizing the verification question generation process for your domain.\n",
    "- Implementing a feedback loop to continuously improve the verification process based on user feedback or expert review.\n",
    "- Combining Chain of Verification with other techniques like Chain of Thought for even more robust reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- Experimenting with different LLM models for various stages of the verification process to optimize for accuracy and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Mirascope's `call` decorator, response models, and dynamic configuration, you can easily implement and customize the Chain of Verification technique to enhance your LLM's accuracy across a wide range of applications.\n"
