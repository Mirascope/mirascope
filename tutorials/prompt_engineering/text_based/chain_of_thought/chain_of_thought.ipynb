    "# Chain of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "[Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903) (CoT) is a common prompt engineering technique which asks the LLM to step through its reasoning and thinking process to answer a question. In its simplest form, it can be implemented by asking asking the LLM to step through a problem step by step, but is more effective when you leverage examples and patterns of reasoning similar to your query in a few shot prompt. Chain of Thought is most effective for mathematical and reasoning tasks.\n",
