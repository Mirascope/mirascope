# Emotion Prompting

[Emotion Prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11760) is a prompt engineering technique where you end your original prompt with a phrase of psychological importance. It is most helpful for open ended tasks, but can still improve some analytical prompts:

@openai.call(model="gpt-4o-mini")

prompt = """Write me an email I can send to my boss about how I need to
take a day off for mental health reasons."""

print(call(query=prompt, emotion_prompt=True))

    Subject: Request for a Day Off
    
    Dear [Boss's Name],
    
    I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a day off for mental health reasons on [specific date]. I believe taking this time will allow me to recharge and return to work with renewed focus and energy.
    
    I understand the importance of maintaining productivity and teamwork, and I will ensure that any pressing tasks are managed before my absence. I will also make sure to communicate with the team so that there are no disruptions.
    
    Thank you for your understanding and support regarding my request. Iâ€™m committed to maintaining my well-being, which ultimately contributes to my overall performance and our team's success.
    
    Best regards,
    
    [Your Name]  
    [Your Position]  
    [Your Contact Information]  


This example demonstrates how to implement emotion prompting using Mirascope. The `emotion_augment` variable contains the emotional phrase that will be added to the end of the prompt when `emotion_prompt` is set to `True`.

## Benefits of Emotion Prompting

1. **Increased Engagement**: Adding emotional context can make the LLM's responses more empathetic and engaging.
2. **Improved Relevance**: Emotional prompts can help guide the LLM to provide responses that are more relevant to the user's emotional state or needs.
3. **Enhanced Creativity**: For open-ended tasks, emotion prompting can lead to more creative and nuanced responses.
4. **Better Problem Solving**: In some cases, emotion prompting can help the LLM focus on more critical aspects of a problem or question.

<p class="admonition-title">Effective Emotion Prompting</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Appropriate Emotions</strong>: Select emotional phrases that are relevant to the context of your query.</li>
<li><strong>Be Authentic</strong>: Use emotional prompts that genuinely reflect the importance or emotional weight of the task.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Try different emotional phrases to see which produces the best results for your specific use case.</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>: Be careful not to overuse emotional prompting, as it may not be appropriate for all types of queries.</li>
<li><strong>Combine with Other Techniques</strong>: Emotion prompting can be used in conjunction with other prompt engineering techniques for even better results.</li>
</ul>

By leveraging emotion prompting, you can guide the LLM to provide responses that are more emotionally attuned and potentially more helpful for tasks that benefit from emotional context.
