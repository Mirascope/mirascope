    "## Benefits of Emotion Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increased Engagement**: Adding emotional context can make the LLM's responses more empathetic and engaging.\n",
    "2. **Improved Relevance**: Emotional prompts can help guide the LLM to provide responses that are more relevant to the user's emotional state or needs.\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Creativity**: For open-ended tasks, emotion prompting can lead to more creative and nuanced responses.\n",
    "4. **Better Problem Solving**: In some cases, emotion prompting can help the LLM focus on more critical aspects of a problem or question.\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>Choose Appropriate Emotions</strong>: Select emotional phrases that are relevant to the context of your query.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Be Authentic</strong>: Use emotional prompts that genuinely reflect the importance or emotional weight of the task.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Try different emotional phrases to see which produces the best results for your specific use case.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Balance</strong>: Be careful not to overuse emotional prompting, as it may not be appropriate for all types of queries.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Combine with Other Techniques</strong>: Emotion prompting can be used in conjunction with other prompt engineering techniques for even better results.</li>\n",

    "By leveraging emotion prompting, you can guide the LLM to provide responses that are more emotionally attuned and potentially more helpful for tasks that benefit from emotional context."
