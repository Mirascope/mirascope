    "\n",
    "[Contrastive Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09277) is an extension of [Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) which involves adding both correct and incorrect examples to help the LLM reason. Contrastive Chain of Thought is applicable anywhere CoT is, such as mathematical and reasoning tasks, but is additionally helpful for scenarios where LLM might be prone to common errors or misunderstandings.\n",
