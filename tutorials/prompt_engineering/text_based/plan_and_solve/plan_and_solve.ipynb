    "\n",
    "[Plan and Solve](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04091) is another variation of zero-shot [Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) whereby the LLM is asked to reason with the improved prompt \"Q: {prompt} A: Let's first understand the problem and devise a plan to solve it. Then, let's carry out the plan and solve the problem step by step\". Plan-and-solve has shown improvements compared to standard CoT in reasoning and mathematical tasks.\n",

This structured approach can lead to more comprehensive and accurate solutions, especially for complex problems that benefit from careful planning before execution. By encouraging the LLM to first grasp the problem and outline a strategy, Plan and Solve can result in more thoughtful and well-organized responses across various types of reasoning and mathematical tasks.\n"
