    "# Rephrase and Respond\n",
    "\n",
    "[Rephrase and respond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04205) (RaR) is a prompt engineering technique which involves asking the LLM to rephrase and expand upon the question before responding. RaR has shown improvements across all types of prompts, but we have personally found that RaR is most effective for shorter and vaguer prompts.\n",

      "A coin starts with the heads side facing up. If Aluino flips the coin, it will land with the tails side facing up. Then Arthur flips the coin again. After these two sequences of flips, can we say that the coin is still heads up? \n",

      "\n",

      "1. **Initial State**: The coin starts with the heads side facing up.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Aluino Flips the Coin**: When Aluino flips the coin, it reverses its position. Since the coin initially was heads up, after Aluino's flip, the coin will now be tails up.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Arthur Flips the Coin**: Next, Arthur takes his turn to flip the coin. Given that the current state of the coin is tails up, flipping it will reverse it again, resulting in the coin now being heads up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of these actions, after both Aluino and Arthur have flipped the coin, the final state of the coin is heads up once more. Thus, the answer to the question is: \n",

    "This example demonstrates how to implement the Rephrase and Respond technique using Mirascope. The `rar_augment` variable contains the instruction for the LLM to rephrase and expand the question before responding.

    "## Benefits of Rephrase and Respond\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Understanding**: By rephrasing the question, the LLM demonstrates and often improves its understanding of the query.\n",
    "2. **Clarity**: The rephrasing can help clarify ambiguous or vague queries.\n",
    "3. **Context Expansion**: The expansion part of RaR allows the LLM to consider additional relevant context.\n",
