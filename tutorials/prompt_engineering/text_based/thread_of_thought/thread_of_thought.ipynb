    "\n",
    "[Thread of Thought](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08734) (THoT) is an extension of zero-shot [Chain of Thought](../chain_of_thought) where the request to walk through the reasoning steps is improved. The paper tests the results of various phrases, but finds the best to be \"Walk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\" It is applicable to reasoning and mathematical tasks just like CoT, but is most useful for tasks with retrieval / large amounts of context and Q and A on this context.\n",

      "To answer the question \"Where was Apple founded?\" let's break down the information available in the retrieved passages step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Identify Founding Information\n",
      "\n",
      "From **retrieved passage 1**, we learn the following:\n",
      "- Apple Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976.\n",
      "- The founders are Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.\n",
      "- The company started in the garage of Jobs' childhood home.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Analyze the Location\n",
      "\n",
      "The precise location mentioned in **retrieved passage 1** is:\n",
      "- **Los Altos, California.**\n",
      "This indicates that Apple was founded in a residential setting, specifically in a garage, which is a common story for many tech startups, illustrating humble beginnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Confirming with Additional Context\n",
      "\n",
      "While the remaining passages provide various pieces of information about Apple, such as the development of its products and its incorporation, they do not provide an alternative founding location. Therefore, the core location remains unchanged by the additional context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Summarizing\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Apple Inc. was founded in **Los Altos, California**, in the garage of Steve Jobs' childhood home. This information highlights the origins of a now-massive corporation, emphasizing that great companies can start in modest environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the answer to the question \"Where was Apple founded?\" is **Los Altos, California**.\n"
