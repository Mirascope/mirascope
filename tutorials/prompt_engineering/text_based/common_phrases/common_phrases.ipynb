        "Sometimes, an LLM can appear to know more or less about a topic depending on the phrasing you use because a specific bit of information shows up far more frequently in its training data with a specific phrasing. Prompt Mining, explained in [this paper](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00324/96460/How-Can-We-Know-What-Language-Models-Know), involves various methods of searching for the phrase which gives the best response regarding a topic.\n",

Here is an example where using common jargon regarding a video game produces a real answer, and a generic prompt doesnâ€™t:\n"

            "Yes, in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Roy has a reliable way to knock out an opponent using an attack that starts with the A button. His forward tilt (dtilt), also known as the \"F tilt,\" is a strong move that can lead to knockouts if used correctly, especially at higher percentages. Additionally, his neutral attack (AAA combo) can set up for follow-up attacks or build damage, although it's not typically a kill move on its own.\n",

            "The timing and spacing are crucial for this combo to work effectively, and it often relies on the opponent being at a higher percentage for the F-tilt to secure the KO. Additionally, if performed correctly, this can work as an effective kill confirm at kill percentages.\n"
