    "This guide introduces advanced techniques for translating from English to Japanese. Due to significant differences in their origins, grammatical structures, and cultural backgrounds, generating natural Japanese through mechanical translation is extremely challenging. The methods presented here are applicable not only to English-Japanese translation but also to translation between any structurally different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore innovative approaches to improve translation quality using Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we will introduce three techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parametrized Translation\n",
    "2. Multi-Pass Translation\n",
    "3. Multi-Provider Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques can be applied to various LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini.\n",
