# Chaining

This document covers chaining multiple LLM calls together to solve complex, multi-step tasks.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to chaining: breaking complex problems into smaller steps
- Function chaining: composing calls like regular Python functions
- Nested chains: calling one prompt function inside another for better observability
- Conditional chaining: routing to different calls based on prior outputs
- Parallel chaining: using `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent independent calls
- Iterative chaining: refining outputs through multiple passes
- Best practices for chain design and debugging
