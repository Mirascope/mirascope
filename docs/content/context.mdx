# Context

This document covers Mirascope's Context system for injecting dependencies at call time.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to the `llm.Context` class and why it's useful
- Creating context subclasses to hold dependencies
- Context prompts: prompts that take `ctx` as their first argument
- Context tools: tools that receive context for accessing shared state
- Passing context when calling: `call(ctx)`, `response.resume(ctx)`, `response.execute_tools(ctx)`
- Type safety: ensuring prompts and tools agree on context type
- Mixing context tools with non-context tools
- The `llm.ContextResponse` type and its generic parameters
