# Agents

This document covers building agents - LLM-powered systems that can act on your behalf.

## Topics Covered

- What an agent is: autonomous systems that use tools to accomplish tasks
- The core agent pattern: tool calling + response resumption
- Building a simple agent loop with `response.tool_calls` and `response.resume()`
- Managing conversation history via `response.messages`
- Human-in-the-loop patterns
- Streaming agent responses for real-time feedback
- Async agents for concurrent tool execution
- State management strategies
- Example: A complete agent implementation
