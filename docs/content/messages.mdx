# Messages

Messages are the fundamental building blocks of LLM interactions. You provide context to the LLM via messages, and it responds by generating messages of its own.

<CodeExample file="examples/messages/basic.py" />

Each message has a `role` (system, user, or assistant) and `content`. Mirascope provides shorthand functions for creating messages: `llm.messages.system()`, `llm.messages.user()`, and `llm.messages.assistant()`.

## Message Roles

Every message is associated with one of three roles: "system", "user", or "assistant". These roles determine how the LLM interprets the message.

<CodeExample file="examples/messages/roles.py" />

### System Messages

System messages are instructions from the application developer and take priority over user messages. Use them to set the LLM's persona, provide specific directives, or include examples of intended behavior.

### User Messages

User messages represent input from the person interacting with the LLM—questions, requests, or any content the LLM should respond to.

### Assistant Messages

Assistant messages are responses from the LLM. You typically don't create these by hand; they come from LLM responses. However, you can construct them manually when building up a conversation history.

## Content Types

Messages can contain more than just text. Modern LLMs support multimodal content, allowing you to include images and audio.

### Text

Text is the most common content type. Plain strings are automatically wrapped as `llm.Text`:

<CodeExample file="examples/messages/text_content.py" lines="3-" />

### Images

Images can be provided via URL (the provider downloads directly) or as base64-encoded data:

<CodeExample file="examples/messages/image_content.py" lines="3-" />

### Audio

Audio content is useful for transcription or voice-based interactions:

<CodeExample file="examples/messages/audio_content.py" lines="3-" />

<Info title="Media Loading Methods" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
`Image` and `Audio` provide consistent class methods for loading:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `from_url(url)` | Reference media by URL (provider downloads it). Image only. |
| `from_file(path)` | Load and encode media from a local file |
| `from_bytes(data)` | Create from raw bytes |
| `download(url)` | Download from URL and encode as base64 |

Note: `from_url` creates a URL reference without downloading. Use `download` if you need the data locally encoded.

### Multimodal Messages

A single message can contain multiple content pieces of different types:

<CodeExample file="examples/messages/multimodal.py" lines="3-" />

## Content Type Reference

| Content Type | Description | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Text` | Plain text content | System, User, Assistant |
| `Image` | Image data (base64 or URL) | User |
| `Audio` | Audio data (base64) | User |
| `ToolCall` | LLM's request to call a tool | Assistant |
| `ToolOutput` | Result from executing a tool | User |
| `Thought` | Model's reasoning process | Assistant |

<Note>
Provider support for content types varies. See the compatibility guide for details on which providers support which content types.
