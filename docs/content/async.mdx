# Async

This document covers asynchronous programming patterns in Mirascope.

## Topics Covered

- General concept of async and why it's relevant for LLM applications
- Async prompt functions and async calls
- The consistency requirement: async prompts require async tools
- Async response types: `llm.AsyncResponse`, `llm.AsyncStreamResponse`
- Async tool execution with `await response.execute_tools()`
- Async streaming with `async for` loops
- Parallel async calls using `asyncio.gather()`
- Best practices for async LLM applications
