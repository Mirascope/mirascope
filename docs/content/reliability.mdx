# Reliability

This document covers reliability patterns for LLM applications.

## Topics Covered

- Using `tenacity` for retry with exponential backoff
- Retrying calls, streams, and tool executions
- Error reinsertion: feeding errors back to the LLM to self-correct
- Catching specific errors and falling back to alternative providers/models
- Combining retries with fallbacks for maximum reliability
