# Responses

This document covers how to work with responses from LLMs.

## Topics Covered

- The core concept of an `llm.Response`
- Using `response.pretty()` for unified, human-readable output
- Accessing specific content: `response.content`, `response.texts`, `response.tool_calls`
- Response metadata: `response.usage`, `response.finish_reason`
- The full message history via `response.messages`
- Continuing conversations with `response.resume()`
- Accessing the raw provider response via `response.raw`
