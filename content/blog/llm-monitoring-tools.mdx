LLM monitoring refers to watching how your model behaves when it's actually being used in production. Not just whether requests are completing and how long they take, but whether it's still giving good answers, staying on-topic, and behaving the way you expect, even as the surrounding code, prompts, or models change.

Monitoring sits on top of observability, which gives you raw visibility into the system, things like logs, traces, metadata, inputs, outputs. Monitoring is how you *use* that visibility: tracking behavior, measuring performance, and setting up alerts when something drifts or breaks.

This matters even more with LLMs, where behavior is unpredictable by design and the same question can give different answers. **Without good monitoring, changes are hidden**, and you won’t know why outputs shifted, when quality dropped, or whether the model is still safe and reliable in real-world use.

So monitoring isn’t just a nice-to-have, but is essential for keeping LLMs reliable, safe, and effective in production. In this article, we’ll explore what good LLM monitoring looks like, why it matters, and how you can go beyond surface metrics to actually understand your system.

We'll also explore some top open source options, starting with [Mirascope Cloud](/docs/learn/ops), our prompt engineering framework. Mirascope Cloud automatically traces and versions the full code context around every LLM call so you don't just see what happened, but know why the model behaved the way it did.

## What Metadata Can’t Tell You

Most LLM monitoring platforms focus on just tracking metadata (things like cost, latency, token usage, and inference time). These metrics are useful, especially for keeping tabs on performance and infrastructure costs. They also originate from deterministic systems, where if everything’s running fast and cheap, you can often assume the system is working correctly. After all, the same input always gives you the same output.

When systems are predictable, tracking system-level metrics is usually enough to figure out what went wrong. But large language models aren’t predictable. They’re sensitive and non-deterministic, which means that if you want to actually understand their behavior, you have to go deeper. **Latency and token count tell you how the system performed, but not why a particular answer came out the way it did**.

To monitor and improve model performance, you need LLM-specific metrics that help you identify the root cause of unexpected behavior. That includes accuracy, correctness, and relevance of outputs, plus hallucination detection. You also need detailed traces of what the model did: what tools it called, which steps it followed in agent workflows, or how, for example, it pulled in data from vector databases (in a [RAG application](/blog/rag-application)). 

Test results are also important. Which prompts, models, or techniques like [prompt chaining](/blog/prompt-chaining) performed best in systematic experiments? What were the trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality? What can you learn from real production data that can help you build better test sets for offline evaluations?

But even platforms that *do* support evaluating LLM responses often focus on the prompt alone, as if it were just a string that you version, tag, and test. The problem is, prompts don’t live in isolation. They’re embedded in real code, shaped by control flow, string construction, helper functions, parameters, and model settings, which all influence the final output. When something goes wrong, it’s not enough to know what prompt was used, but how it was used. 

**That’s why effective LLM monitoring captures the entire context of the call**, because if you want to explain the root cause of a weird output, reproduce a bug, or compare two strategies side-by-side, you need to be able to rerun the exact version of the function that produced it; not just the prompt, but everything that shaped the call.

To help you monitor and improve large language models with the clarity needed, below are six [LLM observability](/blog/llm-observability) tools that are open source and that trace behavior, capture context, and support systematic evaluation.

## LLM Monitoring Tools That Are Open Source and Free

### 1. Mirascope Cloud: Captures the Why Behind LLM Outputs

![Mirascope Cloud Landing Page](/assets/blog/_shared/lilypad-landing-page.webp)

[Mirascope Cloud](/docs/learn/ops) is an open source framework built for tracking, debugging, and optimizing [LLM applications](/blog/llm-applications), letting developers run their LLM workflows with the same insight, traceability, and reliability they're used to when working with traditional software.

Instead of treating prompt engineering like trial and error, Mirascope Cloud treats it as an optimization problem by capturing the full code context around every LLM call, versioning changes automatically, and providing tools to evaluate, compare, and improve outputs in a systematic, repeatable way.

Mirascope Cloud also captures surface-level metrics, like the latency of every span. For spans that involve LLM API calls, it logs the cost of the call and gives you visibility into token usage, making it easier to track performance over time.

#### Versioning LLM Calls with Full Context

To start tracking standard metadata about every LLM API call, like latency, cost, token usage, and inputs, you add `ops.configure()` and `ops.instrument_llm()` to your code.

Mirascope Cloud uses the [OpenTelemetry Gen AI spec](https://opentelemetry.io/) to produce a full record of the model's execution path. If your code is already instrumented with OpenTelemetry, it works with Mirascope Cloud automatically (no changes needed). So if you make a call to Google's Gemini API, for instance, that call shows up in your Mirascope Cloud project as a detailed span.

```python
from mirascope import llm, ops

ops.configure()  # [!code highlight]
ops.instrument_llm()  # [!code highlight]

@llm.call("google/gemini-2.0-flash")
def answer_question(question: str) -> str:
    return f"Answer this question: {question}"

response = answer_question("What is the capital of France?")
print(response.text())
# > The capital of France is Paris.
```

![Mirascope Cloud LLM Span](/assets/blog/llm-monitoring-tools/lilypad-llm-span.webp)

But system-level metrics only tell part of the story. To truly understand why an LLM produced a certain response (or behaved unexpectedly) you need to trace what happened inside the call itself, not just around it.

Mirascope Cloud lets you trace the full context of a prompt by recommending you encapsulate the following in a Python function:

* The prompt text or template.  
* Input arguments, including all inputs that go into a call, such as the user query, chat history, and desired response length.  
* Model settings, like provider, version, `temperature`, or `top-p`.  
* Helper functions or classes, such as any user-defined functions or classes within the LLM function’s scope.  
* Pre- and post-processing logic, like how inputs are prepared and how outputs are parsed or validated.  
* Control flow and logic, such as the code structure and any logic that affects the LLM’s behavior.  
* Structured return types, such as Pydantic models, which are tracked as new versions when changed.

This gives you a full snapshot of the code context behind outputs, which in turn helps reproduce results and understand how changes impact model performance.

Once your function is set up, you then decorate it with `@ops.version`, which turns the function (and every LLM call it makes) into a versioned, traceable software artifact. Every change inside that function is automatically versioned and recorded.

```python
from mirascope import llm, ops

ops.configure()  # [!code highlight]
ops.instrument_llm()  # [!code highlight]

@ops.version  # [!code highlight]
@llm.call("openai/gpt-4o")
def answer_question(question: str) -> str:
    return f"Answer this question: {question}"

answer = answer_question("Who painted the Mona Lisa?")  # automatically versioned
print(answer.text())
# > The Mona Lisa was painted by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
```

This makes LLM interactions reproducible, debuggable, and easy to compare, so you can quickly identify the root cause of any unexpected behavior. You can roll back to a previous version, run A/B tests, and track performance over time without losing the thread of what changed or why. Mirascope Cloud avoids creating duplicate versions if nothing inside the function has changed, so your version history stays clean.

![Mirascope Cloud Trace](/assets/blog/_shared/lilypad-trace.webp)

Inside the Mirascope Cloud UI, you can view side-by-side comparisons of spans and function versions and can click the "Compare" button to see exactly what was different between two runs:

![Mirascope Cloud Click Compare](/assets/blog/_shared/lilypad-click-compare.webp)

You can select another version and view the differences side-by-side:

![Mirascope Cloud Compare Versions](/assets/blog/_shared/lilypad-compare-versions-v2.webp)

Alongside each call, the UI also shows detailed metadata, like latency, cost, and inputs,  giving you full visibility into what happened and what influenced the result.

You can also work with different versions downstream using commands like `.version`, for example:

```python-snippet-skip
response = answer_question.version(6)("Who painted the Mona Lisa?")
```

This gives you access to much of the same versioning functionality as the Mirascope Cloud UI, such as A/B testing for different subsets of users.

You can find more details on Mirascope Cloud's observability solution and working with versions and traces in our [documentation](/docs/learn/ops). 

#### Prompt Editing and Monitoring

The Mirascope Cloud playground gives non-technical users like SMEs a simple way to edit prompts and observe how the model responds without needing to touch the underlying code.

The playground allows users to write prompt templates in markdown using typed variable placeholders for inputs. Whenever you do [prompt optimization](/blog/prompt-optimization), whether it's rewording a sentence or changing a temperature setting, Mirascope Cloud automatically generates a new version of the underlying Python function behind the scenes.

Each time the function runs, users can monitor not only the response but also metadata like the response time, the full Python code that wrapped the LLM call, the function signature and return types, and the exact message payload that was sent to the model.

![Mirascope Cloud Playground Trace](/assets/blog/llm-monitoring-tools/lilypad-playground-trace.webp)

This lets you see if a change in the LLM's response was caused by a code update, a prompt adjustment, or a different set of input arguments. Outputs aren't just "prompt in, text out"; they're part of a full audit trail that ties each result back to the logic that produced it.

The playground also displays the underlying Python functions (those decorated with `@ops.version`) that are used in production. Even if Mirascope Cloud were to go down, your code would still run as expected. 

Each prompt template is tied to a specific function signature, ensuring strong typing and reproducibility. Inputs are checked for type safety, which helps prevent common bugs like missing fields, formatting issues, or injection risks.

#### Turning Logged Runs Into Reliable Evaluation Datasets

A big part of monitoring large language models is about evaluating whether the outputs your model produces are actually any good. And because outputs are non-deterministic, systematic [LLM evaluation](/blog/llm-evaluation) provides the signal needed to judge quality, detect regressions, and guide improvements.

Mirascope Cloud's framework simplifies the evaluation process by using a pass/fail labeling system (with reasoning), which is faster and more practical for subjective tasks like summarization or reasoning than granular scoring.

In granular scoring, for instance, evaluation metrics might include rating scale from 1 to 5. But objectively rating the difference between a 3 and 4 for any given output could be challenging. A simple binary system of "pass" or "fail" can make it easier for teams to align on what counts as "good enough" in the real world.

![Mirascope Cloud Annotation Queue](/assets/blog/_shared/lilypad-annotation-queue.webp)

This kind of binary labeling makes it easier for domain experts to annotate outputs directly in Mirascope Cloud traces or in the playground interface, helping create a continuous feedback loop.

Each annotation is saved alongside the trace and the exact version of the function that produced it. To keep evaluations fair, Mirascope Cloud hides existing annotations when someone is reviewing a trace. That way, each reviewer gives feedback without being influenced by what others said.

![Mirascope Cloud Annotations](/assets/blog/_shared/lilypad-annotations.webp)

Mirascope Cloud encourages manual labeling early in a project to build a strong, high-quality dataset of human-reviewed results. These labeled examples can later be used to train automated evaluators like [LLM-as-a-judge](/blog/llm-as-judge). Even with automation, though, Mirascope Cloud recommends keeping humans in the loop to verify final results.
