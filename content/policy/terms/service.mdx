    2.8. **Documentation.** Customer may copy and use (and permit the Authorized Users to
    copy and use) the Documentation solely in connection with the use of the Platform under
    this Agreement.   

    2.9. **Third-Party Items.** The Platform may include, or be dependent on, certain

    ENDORSE ANY THIRD-PARTY ITEMS, AND MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
    WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD-PARTY ITEMS AND DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH WARRANTIES

    ("**Third-Party AI Models Terms and Conditions**") and your Input may be used by such
    third parties in accordance with such Third-Party AI Models Terms and Conditions.

    own risk and Mirascope does not represent, undertake or warrant to any security or

    access to your instance of Self-Hosted SaaS Solution in order to debug and resolve any
    issues you may encounter. Such access is enabled by default, but you may opt-out by
    disabling it from the "Settings" of the Self-Hosted SaaS Solution. By disabling the

    of the Support Services provided by  Mirascope under this Agreement.

    and/or our contractors shall periodically monitor the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution
    to optimize performance, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
    downtime, other than for scheduled maintenance or downtime caused by reasons beyond our
    reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of any governmental
    body, war, insurrection, sabotage, armed conflict, terrorism, embargo, fire, flood,
    strike or other labor disturbance, unavailability of or interruption or delay in
    telecommunications or third-party services, or virus attacks or hackers. We will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any unavailability or other issue
    with the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution. You and your Authorized Users will be
    responsible for obtaining Internet connections and other third-party software and
    services necessary for them to access the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution.

    its subscription plan ("**Overage**"), Customer will correct the Overage by purchasing
    additional licenses within fifteen (15) days of the Overage. If Customer does not
    purchase licenses for the Overage within such fifteen (15) day period, Mirascope may
    suspend Customer’s use of the Platform by providing five (5) days prior notice. Customer
    agrees (i) that Mirascope may access to view Self-Hosted SaaS Solution and (ii) to
    provide Mirascope with all information reasonably required for the purpose of verifying
    Customer’s compliance with subscription plan usage, which may be in the form of a formal
    certification. 

    2.15. **Privacy Policy.** Your use of the Platform may involve the transmission to us
    of certain personal information. Our policies with respect to the collection and use of
    such personal information are governed according to our Privacy Policy, located at

    users or third parties. 

    3.3. **Aggregated Data.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may use,
    and may permit our third-party service providers to access and use, the Customer Data,

    such Aggregate Data.

RENEW UNDER THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS FOR CANCELLATION, AND YOU UNDERSTAND
AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL RECEIVE NO REFUND OR EXCHANGE FOR ANY UNUSED TIME OF THE
SUBSCRIPTION ACCORDING TO THE CHOSEN PREFERENCES (EITHER A MONTHLY OR A YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION).  

We reserve the right to institute new or additional fees, at any time upon notice to you. 

12. **COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS**

The Platform is based in the United States.  We make no claims concerning whether the Platform
may be viewed or be appropriate for use outside of the United States.  If you access the
Platform from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk.  Whether inside or
outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the
laws of your specific jurisdiction. 

13. **TERM AND TERMINATION**

Your right to access and use the Platform will commence upon your acceptance of these Terms
of Service and will continue for the duration of the subscription plan that you selected at
registration (the "**Initial Term**"). Thereafter, this Agreement will automatically renew
for consecutive terms equivalent to the duration of your subscription plan (each, a
"**Renewal Term**" and collectively, with the Initial Term, the "**Term**"), unless you
notify us at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current renewal
term of your intention to not renew. 

Your right to access and use the Mirascope Router will commence upon your acceptance of these Terms
of Service and purchase of Credits.

If you fail to pay the applicable Fees when due, we reserve the right to downgrade your
subscription to the Platform to the free plan. You shall retain access to Platform offered
under the free plan, but premium features and benefits associated with the paid subscription
will no longer be available. We may reinstate your paid subscription upon receipt of the
outstanding payment in full. 

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement: (i) you will stop all access to and use of
the Platform; provided, however, if you have purchased a subscription to the Self-Hosted
Hosted SaaS Solution, then you will retain the right to access and use the free version of
the Self-Hosted Hosted SaaS Solution; (ii) you will promptly pay all unpaid Fees and
applicable taxes due through the date of such termination or expiration; and (iii) with
respect to Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution and provided all Fees due under the Agreement in
connection with Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution have been paid, Customer will have up to
thirty (30) days from the effective date of the termination or expiration of this Agreement
to retrieve all Customer Data from the Platform and thereafter, Mirascope will have no
obligation to retain Customer Data or make Customer Data available to Customer. Your
continued access to the free version of the Self-Hosted Hosted SaaS Solution as per (ii)
is subject to your and your Authorized Users’ compliance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Mirascope shall not be obligated to provide any Support Services for the
free version and Mirascope reserves the right to modify or discontinue the free version
at its sole discretion without prior notice. 

We reserve the right to change, suspend, discontinue or terminate your access and use of
all or any part of the Platform or the Mirascope Router at any time without prior notice or
liability. Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13 -20 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. 

14. **<u>BINDING ARBITRATION"</u>**

In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Platform, or
any products or services (each, a "<u>Dispute</u>"), such dispute will be finally and
exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
("<u>FAA</u>"). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR
TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS
COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S 
JURISDICTION.  ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY
ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.  All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator
selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right
of appeal under the FAA.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS
pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in
accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant
to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and
procedures are available at the JAMS website [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). Each party
will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in
accordance with JAMS rules.  Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies
in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The arbitration may be
conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted
in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. 
The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending
arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
arbitrator.  The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange
of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored
information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. 
Nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.  

15. **CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and
you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall
be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated
or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is
no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on
behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 

16. **EQUITABLE RELIEF**

You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our
intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will
suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this
Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any
court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is
necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced
above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of California for purposes of any
such action by us. 

17. **CONTROLLING LAW; EXCLUSIVE FORUM**

The Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of
California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  Except for disputes that are
subject to binding arbitration as set forth in Section 14, the Parties hereby consent and agree
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of California
for all suits, actions, or proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and waive any and all objections to such courts, including but not limited to, objections
based on improper venue or inconvenient forum, and each party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suits, actions, or proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement  

18. **FORCE MAJEURE.**

Mirascope will not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement for any failure or delay in
performance to the extent caused by reasons beyond its reasonable control, including, but
not limited to, acts of God, acts of any governmental body, war, insurrection, sabotage,
armed conflict, terrorism, embargo, fire, flood, strike or other labor disturbance,
COVID-19, quarantine restrictions, freight embargoes, unavailability of or interruption
or delay in telecommunications or third-party services, or virus attacks or hackers
(collectively, "<u>Force Majeure Event</u>"). When such Force Majeure Event arises, Mirascope
shall promptly notify you of its failure to perform, describing the cause of failure and
how it affects performance, and the anticipated duration of the inability to perform. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 18 shall be construed to excuse any payment
obligations hereunder. 

19. **EXPORT CONTROL LAWS.**

Our Platform may be subject to export control laws and regulations of the United States.
You hereby certify that you and your Authorized Users will comply with all U.S. export
control laws and regulations including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations ("ITAR") (22CFR 120-130), Export Administration Regulations ("EAR")
(15CFR 730-774) and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") (31CFR 500598) (collectively, the "**Export Control Laws**").
You and your Authorized Users agree not to, directly or indirectly, use, sell, supply,
export, reexport, transfer, divert, release, or otherwise dispose of the Platform, Software
and any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such
technology) received from  Mirascope under this Agreement to any destination, entity, or
person or for any end use prohibited by applicable Export Controls Laws. 

20. **MISCELLANEOUS.**

You may not assign any of your rights, duties, or obligations under these Terms of Service
to any person or entity, in whole or in part, without written consent from Mirascope. Our
failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.  No waiver shall be
effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a
waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  Except as expressly agreed by us and you in
writing, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to
the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether
written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. You acknowledge
and agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement. The section
headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. 
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and
sublicensees.
