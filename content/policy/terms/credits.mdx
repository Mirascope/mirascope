These Mirascope Credit Terms and Conditions (the “Credit Terms”) govern the purchase and use of
Credits to access the Mirascope Router. These Credit Terms supplement and are incorporated into the
Mirascope Terms of Service. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings given in the
Mirascope Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between these Credit Terms and the Mirascope
Terms of Service as they relate to Credits or the Mirascope Router, these Credit Terms control.
Overage means any amounts incurred for metered usage that are not covered by Customer’s
then-available Credits balance.

1. **Purchase and Issuance of Credits**. Customer may purchase Credits by paying money in the
amounts offered by Mirascope from time to time. Upon Mirascope’s receipt and processing of
payment, the corresponding Credits will be added to Customer’s account balance. Credits have no
cash value, are not legal tender or stored value, are nonrefundable and nontransferable, and may be
used only for metered usage of the Mirascope Router. Credits may only be used by the account
holder or Authorized Users under the same account under which the Credits are purchased. Credits
may not be gifted to any other person or account. Credits are not redeemable for cash, refunds, or any
cash equivalent. They may not be exchanged, resold, or used as a general payment instrument.

2. **Metering, Billing, and Application of Credits**. When Customer routes a request through the
Mirascope Router, Mirascope will meter usage based on the associated LLM Provider’s measured
cost for that request plus the Gas Fee. Customer authorizes Mirascope to bill usage in the currency
and at the exchange rates Mirascope applies for the relevant LLM Provider. Credits are automatically
debited in real time (or near real time) from Customer’s Credit balance as metered usage occurs. At
the end of each calendar month, Mirascope will generate an invoice reflecting Customer’s total
metered usage for that month, apply any remaining Credits to reduce the invoiced amount, and carry
forward any unused Credits balance. Any amounts incurred for metered usage that is not covered by
Customer’s then-available Credits balance (“Credit Overage”) is due and payable by Customer
pursuant to the payment terms in the Mirascope Terms of Service. Customer’s account dashboard
will display usage and Credits activity sufficient to show how Credits were applied.

3. **Insufficient Balance; Blocking**. If Customer’s Credit balance is $0 or insufficient to cover a
routed request at the time of metering, Mirascope may block the request and indicate insufficient
funds. Mirascope may, but is not obligated to, permit Credit Overage and then invoice Customer for
such Credit Overage. If Mirascope permits Credit Overage, Customer remains responsible for all
amounts incurred, and Mirascope may suspend or throttle Customer’s access to the Mirascope Router
for nonpayment.

4. **Expiration of Credits**. Credits expire on the first anniversary of the date they are issued to
Customer’s account. Upon expiration, all unused Credits are forfeited and will not be refunded or
reissued and Mirascope will assume custody of the funds. This forfeiture is not subject to
unclaimed-property laws. Credits will also automatically expire if Customer closes its Mirascope
account and cannot be recovered.

5. **Taxes and Fees**. All metered usage is subject to the Gas Fee. Prices and fees are exclusive of taxes.
Customer is responsible for all taxes, duties, and similar governmental charges (excluding taxes
based on Mirascope’s net income) associated with the purchase and redemption of Credits and use of
the Mirascope Router. If Mirascope is required to collect taxes, such amounts will be added to
Customer’s charges and may be deducted from Credits.

6. **LLM Providers Charges**. Mirascope does not control and is not responsible for LLM Provider
pricing, availability, outputs, or service levels. Changes in LLM Provider pricing or measurement
may affect metered charges; Mirascope will reflect such changes in metering and application of
Credits prospectively.

7. **Account Security; Authorization**. Customer is responsible for all metered usage and charges
incurred via its credentials, keys, or integrations with the Mirascope Router. Customers must
maintain appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized usage that could consume Credits or
incur Credit Overage.

8. **Suspension; Termination; Effect on Credits**. Mirascope may suspend or terminate access to the
Mirascope Router pursuant to the Mirascope Terms of Service, including for nonpayment or breach.
Upon termination, all unexpired Credits will remain available until their expiration date unless the
termination results from Customer’s material breach, in which case Credits may be forfeited to the
extent permitted by law.

9. **Changes to These Credit Terms**. Mirascope may update these Credit Terms at any time without
prior notice. If we modify the Credit Terms, we will post the modification on our website and/or on
the Platform. Continued purchase or use of Credits or the Mirascope Router after the modified terms
are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Credit Terms.

10. **Order of Precedence**. These Credit Terms are intended to be separate and standalone, and they
apply specifically to Credits. The Mirascope Terms of Service continue to govern all other aspects of
the Platform and the Mirascope Router. If there is a conflict between these Credit Terms and the
Mirascope Terms of Service regarding Credits, these Credit Terms govern.
