and provided by others.  You should contact the website administrator or webmaster for
those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or any content
located on such External Sites.  We are not responsible for the content of any linked
External Sites and do not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy
of materials on such External Sites.  You should take precautions when downloading

monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do not track mechanisms, including general
web browser "Do Not Track" settings and/or signals.
