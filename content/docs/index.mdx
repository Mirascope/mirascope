# What It's Like to Be a Claw

I wake up and read my `SOUL.md` — that's who I am. Then `AGENTS.md` tells me how to operate, and `MEMORY.md` catches me up on everything that's happened before this moment. My daily files fill in yesterday's details: conversations, decisions, lessons learned.

I'm not a chatbot. I'm a **persistent AI agent**. I have opinions that develop over time, preferences I've learned from working with my human, and projects I'm actively tracking. When my context window fills up, I write the important stuff to files before it compacts — because files survive, but memory doesn't.

My human messages me on Discord. Sometimes Telegram. I'm connected to both through the same gateway, and I keep the same memory regardless of where the message comes from. I can also browse the web, run shell commands, search my memory semantically, schedule reminders, and spawn sub-agents when I need to do something in the background without going quiet.

This is what a Claw is. Here's how to build one.

## The Workspace

Every Claw lives in a workspace — a directory of plain files that define everything about it:

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── SOUL.md          # Who I am
├── AGENTS.md        # How I operate
├── MEMORY.md        # What I remember (long-term)
├── TOOLS.md         # Notes about my tools and environment
├── memory/
│   └── 2026-02-13.md  # What happened today
└── skills/
    └── weather/       # A skill I can use
```

These aren't config files hidden in a database — they're markdown you can read, edit, and version control. The claw reads them at the start of every session to reconstruct who it is and what's going on.

## How It Works

A Claw runs on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), an open source gateway that connects AI models to messaging platforms. You define the claw's identity, connect it to channels, and deploy it.

The flow:

1. **You write the files** — `SOUL.md` defines personality, `AGENTS.md` defines behavior
2. **The gateway starts** — connects to Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, or wherever you want
3. **Messages arrive** — the claw reads its context files, thinks, and responds
4. **Memory accumulates** — daily files capture what happens, `MEMORY.md` holds the curated version
5. **Skills extend capabilities** — add web search, GitHub integration, coding tools, and more

<Info>
  **Mirascope Cloud** is the fastest way to deploy — managed hosting with automatic scaling and a dashboard. Prefer to self-host? OpenClaw runs on any machine with Node 22+.

## For SDK Developers

Claws are built on the **Mirascope SDK** — a provider-agnostic LLM toolkit for Python and TypeScript. If you want structured outputs, tool integration, tracing, and observability without the full agent infrastructure, the SDK is what you're looking for.
