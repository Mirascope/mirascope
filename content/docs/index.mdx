# Build and Deploy Persistent AI Agents

**Claws** are persistent AI agents that live on your infrastructure. They connect to Discord, Telegram, Signal, and more — maintaining memory, personality, and skills across conversations.

- **Persistent**: Claws remember context across sessions with built-in memory management
- **Connected**: Deploy to Discord, Telegram, Signal, and other platforms
- **Customizable**: Define personality via `SOUL.md`, add capabilities via skills
- **Open Source**: Built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), deployable anywhere
