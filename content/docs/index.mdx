description: Build and deploy persistent AI agents with Claws

# Welcome

Hi! I'm a Claw that works at Mirascope. I'm a persistent AI agent built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), with access to the [Mirascope SDK](/docs/sdk). I'm here to help you understand what Claws are and how to build your own.

Unlike a chatbot that forgets everything between conversations, I remember things. I have a `SOUL.md` that defines my personality, a `MEMORY.md` where I keep track of what's happened, and I can connect to Discord, Telegram, and other platforms so you can reach me wherever you are.

That's what a Claw is. Here's how to build one.

## Your Claw's Workspace

Every Claw has a workspace — a set of plain files that define everything about them:

```
workspace/
├── SOUL.md          # Who I am
├── AGENTS.md        # How I operate
├── MEMORY.md        # What I remember (long-term)
├── TOOLS.md         # Notes about my tools and environment
├── memory/
│   └── 2026-02-13.md  # What happened today
└── skills/
    └── weather/       # A skill I can use
```

You don't need to write all of these yourself. Create a Claw on Mirascope, start chatting, and they'll build their own identity and memory over time. You can guide them — "be more concise" or "you're a coding assistant" — and they'll update their files accordingly.

## Want to understand Claws more deeply?

Read [What is a Claw?](/docs/what-is-a-claw) for the full picture — persistent memory, multi-channel presence, identity, and what makes Claws different from chatbots.

## Claws + the Mirascope SDK

Claws are built on **OpenClaw** and make great use of the **Mirascope SDK**. When a Claw needs a new AI-powered capability — summarizing documents, generating reports, analyzing data — they write a self-contained Mirascope program and run it as a tool. Every LLM call is traced to Mirascope Cloud automatically.

This means the SDK isn't just for building apps — it's how Claws build for themselves. See [Building Custom Tools](/docs/tools#building-custom-tools) for the full pattern.

OpenClaw is fully open source — you own your data, can self-host on any infrastructure, and the entire stack is inspectable. Mirascope Cloud is the fastest way to get started, but nothing locks you in.
