# Welcome to Mirascope

The complete toolkit for building LLM-powered applications.

- **Provider-agnostic**: One API for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Observable by default**: Tracing, versioning, and analytics built-in
- **Production-ready**: Tools, structured outputs, and reliable error handling
- **Cloud-native**: Dashboard, cost tracking, and team collaboration

## Get Started

### 1. Create a Mirascope Cloud account

[Sign up for Mirascope Cloud](/cloud/login) to get your API key.
Your key will be generated during onboarding, or you can create one later in [settings](/cloud/settings/api-keys).

### 2. Install Mirascope

<TabbedSection>
<Tab value="uv">
```bash
uv add "mirascope[all]"
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="pip">
```bash
pip install "mirascope[all]"
```
</Tab>
</TabbedSection>

### 3. Set your API key

```bash
export MIRASCOPE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

<Info>
Your Mirascope API key enables two features:

- **Router**: A single key for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Cloud**: Automatic tracing and analytics in your dashboard

To use the Router, purchase credits in [Billing](/cloud/settings/billing).

Prefer to use your own provider keys? See [Providers](/docs/learn/llm/providers) for configuration.

## Your First Agent

Here's a complete agent that uses tools, tracing, and versioning:

<CodeExample file="python/examples/intro/welcome.py" />

This example shows the core Mirascope patterns:

- **Tools** let the LLM call your functions (traced with `@ops.trace`)
- **Versioning** with `@ops.version` tracks changes to your prompts and traces automatically
- **Tracing** on `run_agent` captures the entire agent loop as a nested trace
- **Router** routes `"openai/gpt-4o-mini"` through your Mirascope API key

## View Your Traces

After running the example, view your traces at [Mirascope Cloud](/cloud/dashboard). You'll see execution time, token usage, costs, and the full call flow.
