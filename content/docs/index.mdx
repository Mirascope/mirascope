description: Build and deploy persistent AI agents with Claws
---

# Welcome

You're about to build something that remembers you.

A **Claw** is a persistent AI agent. It reads its `SOUL.md` to know who it is, checks `MEMORY.md` to recall what's happened, and connects to your Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp to meet you where you already are. It doesn't start fresh every conversation — it picks up where it left off.

## What You'll Build

A workspace of plain files that define your Claw:

```
my-claw/
├── SOUL.md          # Your Claw's identity and personality
├── AGENTS.md        # How it should operate
├── MEMORY.md        # What it remembers (grows over time)
├── skills/          # Modular capabilities you add
└── openclaw.json    # Gateway and channel configuration
```

You write these files. Your Claw reads them every session. That's it — no database, no dashboard required. Everything is markdown you can read, edit, and version control.

## For SDK Developers

Claws are built on the **Mirascope SDK** — a provider-agnostic LLM toolkit for Python and TypeScript. If you want structured outputs, tool integration, tracing, and observability without the full agent infrastructure:
