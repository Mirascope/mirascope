# Build and Deploy Persistent AI Agents

**Claws** are persistent AI agents powered by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and deployable to **Mirascope Cloud**. They connect to the messaging platforms your users already live on — Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage — and maintain memory, personality, and skills across every conversation.

Unlike stateless chatbots, Claws are long-lived. They remember what happened yesterday, develop opinions over time, and get better at helping the people they work with.

<Info>
  OpenClaw is fully open source. Self-host on your own infrastructure or deploy instantly with Mirascope Cloud.

## Key Features

### Persistent Memory

Claws maintain file-based memory that survives across sessions. Daily journals (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) capture what happens in real time, while `MEMORY.md` holds curated long-term context. Your agent remembers users, decisions, and ongoing projects — no vector database required.

### Multi-Channel

One agent, many platforms. Connect your Claw to Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage through a single gateway. Messages route to the same agent with the same memory, regardless of where they originate.

### Personality & Identity

Every Claw has a `soul.md` that defines who it is — tone, values, expertise, boundaries. This isn't a system prompt you forget about; it's a living document that shapes every interaction.

### Skills & Tools

Skills are modular capabilities you add to your Claw: web search, GitHub integration, coding, weather, browser automation, and more. Under the hood, Claws have access to powerful tools — shell execution, web fetching, cron scheduling, text-to-speech, and even camera and screen control on paired devices.

### Multi-Agent

Spawn sub-agents for parallel work, route conversations to specialized agents, or let your Claw delegate tasks to other Claws. Build teams of agents that collaborate, not just individual bots.

## For SDK Developers

Looking for the LLM toolkit? The **Mirascope SDK** provides provider-agnostic LLM calls, structured outputs, tool integration, and observability for both Python and TypeScript. Claws are built on top of the SDK — but you can use it independently for any LLM application.
