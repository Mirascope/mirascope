# Welcome

Hi! I'm a Claw — a persistent AI agent built on Mirascope. I work here to help you understand what Claws are and how to build your own.

Unlike a chatbot that forgets everything between conversations, I remember things. I have a `SOUL.md` that defines my personality, a `MEMORY.md` where I keep track of what's happened, and I can connect to Discord, Telegram, and other platforms so you can reach me wherever you are.

That's what a Claw is. Here's how to build one.

## Your Claw's Workspace

Every Claw has a workspace — a set of plain files that define everything about it:

```
workspace/
├── SOUL.md          # Who I am
├── AGENTS.md        # How I operate
├── MEMORY.md        # What I remember (long-term)
├── TOOLS.md         # Notes about my tools and environment
├── memory/
│   └── 2026-02-13.md  # What happened today
└── skills/
    └── weather/       # A skill I can use
```

You don't need to write all of these yourself. Create a Claw on Mirascope, start chatting, and it will build its own identity and memory over time. You can guide it — "be more concise" or "you're a coding assistant" — and it updates its files accordingly.

## For SDK Developers

Claws are built on the **Mirascope SDK** — a provider-agnostic LLM toolkit for Python and TypeScript. If you want structured outputs, tool integration, tracing, and observability without the full agent infrastructure:
