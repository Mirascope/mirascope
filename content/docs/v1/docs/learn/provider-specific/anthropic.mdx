# Anthropic-Specific Features

## Prompt Caching

Anthropic's prompt caching feature can help save a lot of tokens by caching parts of your prompt. For full details, we recommend reading [their documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching).

<Warning title="This Feature Is In Beta">
  While we've added support for prompt caching with Anthropic, this feature is still in beta and requires setting extra headers. You can set this header as an additional call parameter.

  As this feature is in beta, there may be changes made by Anthropic that may result in changes in our own handling of this feature.
</Warning>

### Message Caching

To cache messages, simply add a `:cache_control` tagged breakpoint to your prompt:

<TabbedSection>
<Tab value="Shorthand">

```python
import inspect

from mirascope import CacheControlPart, Messages
from mirascope.core import anthropic


@anthropic.call(
    "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    call_params={
        "max_tokens": 1024,
        "extra_headers": {"anthropic-beta": "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"}, # [!code highlight]
    },
)
def analyze_book(query: str, book: str) -> Messages.Type:
    return [
        Messages.System(
            [
                inspect.cleandoc(
            f"""

            """),
                CacheControlPart(type="cache_control", cache_type="ephemeral"), # [!code highlight]
            ]
        ),
        Messages.User(query),
    ]


print(analyze_book("What are the major themes?", "[FULL BOOK HERE]"))
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Template">

```python
from mirascope import prompt_template
from mirascope.core import anthropic


@anthropic.call(
    "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    call_params={
        "max_tokens": 1024,
        "extra_headers": {"anthropic-beta": "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"}, # [!code highlight]
    },
)
@prompt_template(
    """
    SYSTEM:

    Your goal is to provide insightful commentary on themes, characters, and writing style.

    Here is the book in it's entirety: {book}

    {:cache_control} # [!code highlight]

    USER: {query}
    """
)
def analyze_book(query: str, book: str): ...


print(analyze_book("What are the major themes?", "[FULL BOOK HERE]"))
```

</Tab>
</TabbedSection>

<Info title="Additional options with string templates" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
  When using string templates, you can also specify the cache control type the same way we support additional options for multimodal parts (although currently `"ephemeral"` is the only supported type):

  ```python-snippet-skip
  @prompt_template("... {:cache_control(type=ephemeral)}")
  ```
</Info>

### Tool Caching

It is also possible to cache tools by using the `AnthropicToolConfig` and setting the cache control:

```python
from mirascope.core import BaseTool, anthropic
from mirascope.core.anthropic import AnthropicToolConfig


class CachedTool(BaseTool):
    """This is an example of a cached tool."""

    tool_config = AnthropicToolConfig(cache_control={"type": "ephemeral"}) # [!code highlight]

    def call(self) -> str:
        return "Example tool"


@anthropic.call(
    "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    tools=[CachedTool], # [!code highlight]
    call_params={
        "max_tokens": 1024,
        "extra_headers": {"anthropic-beta": "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"}, # [!code highlight]
    },
)
def cached_tool_call() -> str:
    return "An example call with a cached tool"
```

Remember only to include the cache control on the last tool in your list of tools that you want to cache (as all tools up to the tool with a cache control breakpoint will be cached).
