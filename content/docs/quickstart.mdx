# Quickstart

Deploy a Claw to Mirascope Cloud and chat with it in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Create a Mirascope Account

Sign up at [mirascope.com/cloud](/cloud/login) to get your API key. Your key is generated during onboarding, or you can create one later in [Settings](/cloud/settings/api-keys).

## 2. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g mirascope
```

## 3. Authenticate

```bash
mirascope auth login
```

This opens your browser to authorize the CLI with your Mirascope account.

## 4. Create Your Claw

```bash
mirascope claw create my-first-claw
```

This scaffolds a new Claw workspace with default configuration files:

```
my-first-claw/
├── SOUL.md          # Your Claw's identity and personality
├── AGENTS.md        # Behavioral instructions
├── MEMORY.md        # Long-term memory (starts empty)
├── TOOLS.md         # Tool notes
└── openclaw.json    # Gateway configuration
```

## 5. Define Your Claw's Identity

Edit `SOUL.md` to give your Claw a personality:

```markdown
# Soul

I'm a helpful assistant named Atlas. I'm knowledgeable, concise, and friendly.
I specialize in answering questions clearly and helping with everyday tasks.

When I'm unsure about something, I say so rather than guessing.
```

## 6. Deploy

```bash
mirascope claw deploy
```

Your Claw is now running on Mirascope Cloud. The CLI will print your Claw's URL and status.

## 7. Send Your First Message

Open your Claw's dashboard in the browser:

```bash
mirascope claw open
```

Send a message in the chat interface. Your Claw will respond using the identity you defined in `SOUL.md`.

## Connect a Channel

Your Claw is running — now connect it to a messaging platform so you can chat from Discord, Telegram, or anywhere else.
