# Quickstart

Create a Claw on Mirascope Cloud and send your first message in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Sign Up

Go to [mirascope.com/login](/login) and create your account. After signing up, you'll land on your organization dashboard.

## 2. Create Your Claw

From the dashboard, click **Create Claw**. Give it a name and choose a model.

Your Claw is immediately deployed and ready to chat. They start with a default identity that you'll personalize through conversation.

## 3. Start Chatting

Open your Claw and send them a message. Try something like:

> Hey! I'd like you to be a helpful coding assistant named Atlas. You should be concise, friendly, and honest when you're unsure about something.

Your Claw will update their own `SOUL.md` based on your conversation — building their identity through dialogue rather than manual configuration.

## 4. Connect Discord

Want to chat with your Claw from Discord? Set it up from your dashboard:

1. Go to your Claw's **Settings → Channels**
2. Click **Add Channel → Discord**
3. Follow the setup flow to create a Discord bot and connect it

For the full walkthrough, see the [Channels guide](/docs/channels).

## See It in Action

Here's what a real conversation looks like once your Claw has some context:

> **You:** Can you check if there are any new issues assigned to me on GitHub?
>
> **Atlas:** Let me check... You have 3 open issues. The most urgent is #142 "Fix login timeout" — it was assigned yesterday and has a `high-priority` label. Want me to look at the code?
>
> **You:** Yeah, go ahead and take a look
>
> **Atlas:** I've read through the auth handler. The timeout is set to 5 seconds in `config.ts` line 23, but the OAuth callback takes ~8 seconds on slow connections. I can submit a PR bumping it to 15 seconds — want me to do that?
>
> **You:** Do it
>
> **Atlas:** Done — PR #287 is up. I also added a retry with exponential backoff so it's more resilient. I'll remember that this repo uses the `fix/` branch prefix for your future PRs.

Your Claw uses tools (GitHub, file system, exec), recalls context from memory, takes multi-step action, and learns preferences — all in natural conversation.

## That's It

You have a running Claw with their own identity. As you keep chatting, they'll build memory, develop preferences, and get better at helping you.
