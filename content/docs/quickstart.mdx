# Quickstart

Create a Claw on Mirascope Cloud and send your first message in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Sign Up

Go to [mirascope.com/login](/login) and create your account. After signing up, you'll land on your organization dashboard.

## 2. Create Your Claw

From the dashboard, click **Create Claw**. Give it a name and choose a model.

Your Claw is immediately deployed and ready to chat. It starts with a default identity that you'll personalize through conversation.

## 3. Start Chatting

Open your Claw and send it a message. Try something like:

> Hey! I'd like you to be a helpful coding assistant named Atlas. You should be concise, friendly, and honest when you're unsure about something.

Your Claw will update its own `SOUL.md` based on your conversation — building its identity through dialogue rather than manual configuration.

## 4. Connect Discord

Want to chat with your Claw from Discord? Set it up from your dashboard:

1. Go to your Claw's **Settings → Channels**
2. Click **Add Channel → Discord**
3. Follow the setup flow to create a Discord bot and connect it

For the full walkthrough, see the [Channels guide](/docs/channels).

## That's It

You have a running Claw with its own identity. As you keep chatting, it will build memory, develop preferences, and get better at helping you.
