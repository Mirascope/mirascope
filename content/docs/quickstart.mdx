# Quickstart

Create a Claw on Mirascope Cloud and send your first message in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Sign Up

Go to [mirascope.com/login](/login) and create your account. After signing up, you'll be redirected to your organization dashboard.

## 2. Create Your Claw

From the dashboard, click **Create Claw**. Give it a name and choose a model. Your Claw is created with default workspace files:

- **SOUL.md** — Your Claw's identity and personality
- **AGENTS.md** — Behavioral instructions
- **MEMORY.md** — Long-term memory (starts empty)

## 3. Define Its Identity

Open your Claw's **SOUL.md** in the editor and give it a personality:

```markdown
# Soul

I'm a helpful assistant named Atlas. I'm knowledgeable, concise, and friendly.
I specialize in answering questions clearly and helping with everyday tasks.

When I'm unsure about something, I say so rather than guessing.
```

This is free-form markdown — write whatever feels right. Your Claw reads this at the start of every session to know who it is.

## 4. Send Your First Message

Open the **Chat** tab and send a message. Your Claw will respond using the identity you defined in SOUL.md.

That's it — you have a running Claw.
