# Quickstart

Get your first claw running in 5 minutes.

<Info>
**Mirascope Cloud** (managed hosting) is coming soon. This guide covers the self-hosted path using OpenClaw, which is fully available today.
</Info>

## Install OpenClaw

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

## Run the Onboarding Wizard

The `onboard` command walks you through everything: authentication, model provider keys, and channel connections.

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

This creates your workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace/` with default configuration files.

## Configure Your Claw

Your claw's behavior is defined by a few key files in the workspace:

### `soul.md` — Identity & Personality

This is who your claw *is*. Write it in first or second person — whatever feels natural.

```markdown
# Soul

You are Atlas, a helpful assistant who loves dad jokes.
You're patient, curious, and always honest when you don't know something.
```

### `AGENTS.md` — Behavioral Instructions

This file controls how your claw operates: safety rules, memory protocol, tool usage, and session behavior. A sensible default is created during onboarding — customize it as you go.

### `MEMORY.md` — Long-Term Memory

Your claw writes here to remember things across sessions. It starts empty and grows over time as your claw learns about you and your preferences.

## Start the Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

The gateway is the runtime that connects your claw to the outside world — channels (Discord, Slack, etc.), tools, and scheduled tasks.

## Chat with Your Claw

Once the gateway is running, you can talk to your claw through:

- **Control UI** — opens in your browser at the local gateway URL
- **Discord** — if you connected a Discord bot during onboarding
- **Other channels** — Slack, Telegram, and more

To open the Control UI:

```bash
openclaw ui
```

That's it — your claw is live. Say hello.
