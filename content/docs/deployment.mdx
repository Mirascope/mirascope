# Deployment

## Mirascope Cloud

The easiest way to run a Claw. Sign up at [mirascope.com/login](/login), create a Claw, and start chatting — no infrastructure to manage.

Mirascope Cloud handles:

- **Hosting** — your Claw runs on managed infrastructure, always available
- **Model access** — use Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and other providers through your Mirascope account
- **Channels** — connect Discord, Telegram, and other platforms from the dashboard
- **Memory** — workspace files stored on cloud storage, persistent across sessions
- **Monitoring** — logs, usage tracking, and session management in the dashboard

To get started, follow the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

## Self-Hosting with OpenClaw

Claws are powered by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), an open source gateway you can run on your own infrastructure. Self-hosting gives you full control over your data, model provider keys, and runtime environment.

Self-hosted Claws can still connect to **Mirascope Cloud** for monitoring, observability, channel management, and the dashboard UI — you get the convenience of Cloud with the control of your own hardware.

Self-hosting is a good fit if you:

- Want your data to stay entirely on your own machines
- Need to use custom model endpoints or local models
- Want to run on specific hardware (Raspberry Pi, dedicated GPU server, etc.)
- Need features or configuration not yet available in Mirascope Cloud

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install OpenClaw
npm install -g openclaw

# Run the onboarding wizard
openclaw onboard
```

For the full self-hosting guide — installation, configuration, reverse proxy setup, systemd services, environment variables, multi-agent setups, and more — see the [OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai).

<Info>
  Whether you use Mirascope Cloud or self-host, your Claw's workspace files (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, skills, etc.) use the same format. You can start on Cloud and move to self-hosting (or vice versa) at any time.
