# Channels

Claws connect to messaging platforms through **channels**. Each channel is a bridge between your claw and a platform like Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp.

You can run **multiple channels simultaneously** — configure as many as you need and OpenClaw routes each conversation to the right one. A single claw can be on Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp at the same time.

Channel configuration lives in `openclaw.json` under `channels.<name>`:

```json5
// ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    },
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
    },
  },
}
```

## Discord — Recommended First Channel

Discord is the easiest channel to set up and the best for development. It supports servers, channels, threads, DMs, reactions, embeds, and more.

### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Navigate to the **Bot** tab

### Step 2: Configure the Bot

1. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - **Message Content Intent** — required to read messages
   - **Server Members Intent** — required for member info
2. Click **Reset Token** to generate a bot token
3. Copy the token — you'll need it in a moment

<Info>
Never share your bot token or commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
</Info>

### Step 3: Add the Token to Your Config

```json5
// ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    },
  },
}
```

### Step 4: Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. In the Developer Portal, go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**
2. Select the **bot** scope
3. Under Bot Permissions, select:
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
   - Add Reactions
   - Attach Files
   - Use Slash Commands (optional)
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser
5. Select your server and authorize

### Step 5: Start the Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

Your claw should come online in your Discord server within a few seconds. Send it a message to test!

<Info>
In servers (guilds), each channel gets its own isolated conversation session. DMs go to the claw's main session.
</Info>

## Telegram

Telegram is the simplest channel to set up — just a bot token from BotFather.

### Step 1: Create a Bot

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the bot token BotFather gives you

### Step 2: Add the Token to Your Config

```json5
// ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
    },
  },
}
```

### Step 3: Start the Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

Message your bot on Telegram to test. It supports both private chats and group conversations.

## All Supported Channels

OpenClaw includes built-in support for these platforms:

| Channel | Setup | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Discord** | Bot token | Recommended for developers. Full server/channel/DM support. |
| **Telegram** | Bot token via BotFather | Simple setup. Supports groups. Uses grammY. |
| **WhatsApp** | QR code pairing | Most popular for personal use. Uses Baileys library. |
| **Signal** | signal-cli setup | Privacy-focused. Requires signal-cli installation. |
| **Slack** | Bolt SDK app | Workspace apps with full Slack API access. |
| **iMessage** | BlueBubbles (macOS) | macOS only. BlueBubbles recommended for new setups. |
| **Google Chat** | HTTP webhook app | Google Workspace integration. |

Each channel is configured under `channels.<name>` in `openclaw.json`. Enable any channel by setting `enabled: true` and providing the required credentials.

## Security

### DM Pairing

When someone sends your claw a direct message for the first time, OpenClaw doesn't automatically trust them. Unknown senders receive a **pairing code** — a short code they must provide to you (the claw owner) to verify their identity.

This prevents strangers from interacting with your claw without your approval.

### Allowlists

You can configure an allowlist to pre-approve specific users, skipping the pairing flow:

```json5
// ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_TOKEN",
    },
  },
  // Allowlist specific user IDs
  allowlist: ["USER_ID_1", "USER_ID_2"],
}
```

<Info>
Guild and group channels don't require pairing — they get isolated sessions automatically. DM pairing only applies to direct messages.
</Info>

---

## Plugin Channels

Beyond the built-in channels, additional platforms are available as **plugins** that can be installed separately:

- Mattermost
- Microsoft Teams
- LINE
- Matrix
- Nostr
- Twitch
- Feishu / Lark
- Nextcloud Talk
- Zalo

Plugin channels follow the same configuration pattern — add them under `channels.<name>` in your `openclaw.json` after installing the plugin.

---

## Running Multiple Channels

One of OpenClaw's strengths is running multiple channels at once. Simply configure each channel in your `openclaw.json` and start the gateway:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "DISCORD_TOKEN",
    },
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "TELEGRAM_TOKEN",
    },
    whatsapp: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
}
```

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

All enabled channels connect simultaneously. Each platform's conversations are routed independently — your claw maintains separate context for each chat.
