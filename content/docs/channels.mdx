# Channels

Claws connect to messaging platforms through **channels**. Each channel is a bridge between your Claw and a platform like Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp.

You can connect **multiple channels simultaneously** — your Claw maintains the same memory and identity regardless of where messages arrive.

---

## Discord — Recommended First Channel

Discord is the easiest channel to set up and the best for development.

### Step 1: Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Navigate to the **Bot** tab
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - **Message Content Intent** — required to read messages
   - **Server Members Intent** — required for member lookups
5. Click **Reset Token** to generate a bot token and copy it

<Info>
Never share your bot token or commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
</Info>

### Step 2: Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. In the Developer Portal, go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**
2. Select the **bot** scope
3. Under Bot Permissions, select:
   - Send Messages
   - Send Messages in Threads
   - Create Public Threads
   - Read Message History
   - Add Reactions
   - Attach Files
4. Copy the generated URL, open it in your browser, and select your server

### Step 3: Connect the Channel

In the Mirascope dashboard, go to your Claw's **Settings → Channels**, click **Add Channel → Discord**, and paste your bot token.

Your Claw should appear online in your Discord server within a few seconds. Send them a message to test!

<Info>
In servers, each channel gets its own isolated conversation session. DMs go to the Claw's main session.

## Telegram

Telegram is the simplest channel to set up — just a bot token from BotFather.

### Step 1: Create a Bot

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the bot token BotFather gives you

### Step 2: Connect the Channel

In the Mirascope dashboard, go to your Claw's **Settings → Channels**, click **Add Channel → Telegram**, and paste your bot token.

Message your bot on Telegram to test. It supports both private chats and group conversations.

## Security

### DM Pairing

When someone DMs your Claw for the first time, they aren't automatically trusted. Unknown senders receive a **pairing code** — a short code they must provide to you (the Claw owner) for verification.

This prevents strangers from interacting with your Claw without your approval.

### Allowlists

You can pre-approve specific users in your Claw's channel settings, skipping the pairing flow for trusted contacts.

<Info>
Guild and group channels don't require pairing — they get isolated sessions automatically. DM pairing only applies to direct messages.
</Info>

## Additional Channels

Beyond the built-in channels, additional platforms are available including Mattermost, Microsoft Teams, LINE, Matrix, Nostr, Twitch, Feishu/Lark, Nextcloud Talk, and Zalo. See the [OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai) for details on additional channel setup.

---

## Running Multiple Channels

Connect as many channels as you want. All channels run simultaneously — your Claw maintains separate conversation context for each chat while sharing the same identity and memory.

<Info>
  Self-hosting? Claws are powered by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), an open source gateway. See the [Deployment guide](/docs/deployment) and [OpenClaw docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai) for self-hosted channel configuration.
