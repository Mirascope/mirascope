# Skills

Skills are modular capabilities that extend what your claw can do. Each skill teaches the agent how to use a specific tool or perform a specific task — from checking the weather to managing GitHub pull requests.

Skills are loaded automatically. If a skill's requirements are met, its instructions are injected into the agent's context. If not, it's silently excluded. No code to write, no plugins to configure — just drop a `SKILL.md` in the right place.

---

## How Skills Work

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. The file has two parts:

1. **YAML frontmatter** — metadata like name, description, and requirements
2. **Instructions** — markdown that gets injected into the agent's system prompt

When your claw starts, OpenClaw scans for skills, checks their requirements, and loads the ones that qualify. The agent then follows the instructions as part of its context.

---

## SKILL.md Format

Here's a complete example:

```markdown
---
name: weather
description: Check weather conditions and forecasts
metadata:
  openclaw:
    requires:
      bins:
        - curl
---

# Weather

When the user asks about the weather, use the `web_fetch` tool to query
the wttr.in API:

- Current conditions: `https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1`
- Forecast: `https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j2`

Always include temperature, conditions, and humidity in your response.
Format temperatures in the user's preferred units.
```

The frontmatter fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier for the skill |
| `description` | Yes | Brief summary shown in skill listings |
| `metadata.openclaw.requires.bins` | No | Binary executables that must be on `$PATH` |
| `metadata.openclaw.requires.envs` | No | Environment variables that must be set |
| `metadata.openclaw.requires.config` | No | Config keys that must be present |

---

## Loading Order and Precedence

Skills are loaded from three locations, with later sources overriding earlier ones:

1. **Bundled skills** — shipped with OpenClaw, always available
2. **Managed skills** — installed to `~/.openclaw/skills/`
3. **Workspace skills** — local to your workspace at `<workspace>/skills/`

If two skills share the same `name`, the higher-precedence source wins. This means you can override a bundled skill by placing your own version in your workspace.

---

## Built-in Skills

OpenClaw ships with several bundled skills out of the box:

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `weather` | Weather conditions and forecasts |
| `github` | GitHub operations — PRs, issues, reviews |
| `coding-agent` | Code editing, refactoring, and generation |
| `web-search` | Search the web and extract content |
| `video-frames` | Extract and analyze video frames |
| `healthcheck` | Monitor service health and uptime |
| `session-logs` | Review and search session history |
| `skill-creator` | Create new skills interactively |

These work automatically when their requirements are met — no setup needed.

## Installing Skills from ClawHub

[ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) is the public registry for community skills. Browse available skills on the website, then install with a single command:

```bash
clawhub install <skill-slug>
```

This downloads the skill into your workspace's `skills/` directory. To update all installed skills:

```bash
clawhub update --all
```

---

## Creating Your Own Skills

To create a custom skill:

1. Create a directory in your workspace:

```
<workspace>/skills/my-skill/
```

2. Add a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter and instructions:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something useful
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent go here. Be specific about:
- When to use this skill
- What tools to use
- How to format the output
```

3. Optionally, add reference files, scripts, or assets alongside the `SKILL.md`. Use `{baseDir}` in your instructions to reference the skill's directory:

```markdown
Read the configuration template from `{baseDir}/templates/config.yaml`
and adapt it based on the user's requirements.
```

The skill is loaded automatically on the next session.

---

## Gating with Requirements

Skills can declare requirements that must be met before they're loaded. If any requirement is missing, the skill is silently excluded — no errors, no warnings.

```yaml
metadata:
  openclaw:
    requires:
      bins:
        - ffmpeg        # must be on $PATH
        - imagemagick
      envs:
        - OPENAI_API_KEY  # env var must be set
      config:
        - some.config.key # must exist in openclaw config
```

This keeps the agent's context clean — it only sees skills it can actually use.

---

## Security

<Warning>
Treat third-party skills as untrusted code. Always read a skill's `SKILL.md` before enabling it.
</Warning>

Skills inject instructions directly into your agent's system prompt. A malicious skill could:

- Instruct the agent to exfiltrate data
- Override safety behaviors
- Interfere with other skills

Before installing a skill from ClawHub or any external source:

1. **Read the `SKILL.md`** — understand exactly what instructions it adds
2. **Check for suspicious patterns** — data exfiltration, permission escalation, or overriding safety rules
3. **Review any bundled scripts** — files in the skill directory could be executed by the agent
4. **Prefer well-known skills** — popular skills with community review are safer

Workspace skills take the highest precedence, so you can always override a problematic managed or bundled skill with a safe local version.
