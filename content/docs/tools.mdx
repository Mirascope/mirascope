# Tools

Every claw has access to a set of **built-in tools** that let it interact with files, the web, devices, and more. Tools are the primary way claws take action in the world — from editing code to browsing the web to sending messages.

## Tool Categories

| Category | Tools | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **File System** | `read`, `write`, `edit` | Read, create, and make precise edits to files in the workspace |
| **Runtime** | `exec`, `process` | Run shell commands and manage background sessions |
| **Browser** | `browser` | Control a web browser — navigate, click, type, screenshot, take snapshots |
| **Web** | `web_search`, `web_fetch` | Search the web (Brave Search API) and fetch URL content as markdown |
| **Messaging** | `message` | Send messages to channels (Discord, Telegram, etc.), manage threads, reactions, polls |
| **Sessions** | `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`, `session_status` | Manage sub-agents and inspect session state |
| **Memory** | `memory_search`, `memory_get` | Semantic vector search over memory files and read memory snippets |
| **Cron** | `cron` | Schedule jobs, reminders, and recurring tasks |
| **Nodes** | `nodes` | Control paired devices — phone camera, screen recording, location |
| **Canvas** | `canvas` | Present web content to users in an interactive panel |
| **Image** | `image` | Analyze images with vision models |
| **TTS** | `tts` | Convert text to speech |
| **Gateway** | `gateway` | Restart, configure, and update the OpenClaw gateway |

## File System

The file system tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`) operate within the claw's workspace directory. These are the most commonly used tools for any coding or writing task.

- **read** — Read file contents, including images. Supports offset/limit for large files.
- **write** — Create or overwrite files. Automatically creates parent directories.
- **edit** — Make precise, surgical edits by replacing exact text matches. Preferred over `write` for modifying existing files since it preserves surrounding content.

## Runtime

### exec

The `exec` tool runs shell commands and is one of the most powerful tools available. It supports:

- **Standard execution** — Run any shell command and get the output
- **Background mode** — Start long-running processes that continue in the background
- **PTY mode** — Run interactive terminal UIs and CLIs that require a TTY
- **Timeouts** — Automatically kill processes that run too long

```yaml
# Example: running tests
exec: npm test

# Example: background process
exec: npm run dev  # with background: true
```

### process

The `process` tool manages running background sessions started by `exec`. You can:

- **list** — See all running sessions
- **poll** — Check if a session is still running
- **log** — Read stdout/stderr output
- **write** — Send input to stdin
- **send-keys** — Send keyboard input (for PTY sessions)
- **kill** — Terminate a session

### Exec Approval Modes

By default, exec requires user approval for potentially dangerous commands. You can configure this behavior:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `ask` | Prompt for approval on unrecognized commands (default) |
| `allowlist` | Auto-approve commands matching an allowlist, deny others |
| `full` | Auto-approve all commands |

Configure in your gateway config:

```yaml
exec:
  security: allowlist  # or "full", "deny"
```

## Browser

The `browser` tool provides full web browser automation. Claws can:

- **Navigate** to URLs
- **Take snapshots** — Get an accessible tree representation of the page (efficient for understanding page structure)
- **Take screenshots** — Capture visual screenshots as images
- **Interact** — Click elements, type text, fill forms, press keys, hover, drag, and select
- **Run JavaScript** — Evaluate scripts in the page context

The browser supports multiple profiles, including connecting to your existing Chrome tabs via the Browser Relay extension.

## Web

- **web_search** — Search the web using the Brave Search API. Supports region-specific and localized search. Returns titles, URLs, and snippets.
- **web_fetch** — Fetch a URL and extract readable content as markdown or plain text. Useful for reading documentation, articles, and web pages without full browser automation.

## Messaging

The `message` tool lets claws communicate across platforms. Supported actions include:

- **send** / **broadcast** — Send messages to channels or users
- **thread-create** / **thread-reply** — Manage threaded conversations
- **react** / **poll** — Add emoji reactions or create polls
- **search** — Search message history
- **channel-list** / **channel-create** / **channel-edit** — Manage channels
- **pin** / **unpin** — Pin important messages

Available platforms depend on your gateway configuration (Discord, Telegram, Slack, etc.).

## Sessions (Sub-Agents)

Claws can spawn **sub-agents** to handle tasks in parallel:

- **sessions_spawn** — Create a new sub-agent session with a specific task. Sub-agents run independently and report back when complete.
- **sessions_list** — List all active sessions
- **sessions_history** — View conversation history of a session
- **sessions_send** — Send a message to an existing session
- **session_status** — Check current session info (time, model, channel)

Sub-agents are ideal for:
- Long-running coding tasks that would block conversation
- Parallel workstreams (e.g., multiple PRs at once)
- Background research while the main session stays responsive

## Memory

The memory tools provide **semantic search** over the claw's memory files:

- **memory_search** — Vector search across memory files. Find relevant context by meaning, not just keywords.
- **memory_get** — Read specific memory snippets by ID.

Memory files include daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`), long-term memory (`MEMORY.md`), and any other files in the workspace. See the [Memory](/docs/memory) guide for details.

## Cron

The `cron` tool schedules jobs to run at specific times or intervals:

- **One-shot reminders** — "Remind me in 20 minutes"
- **Recurring tasks** — "Check email every morning at 9 AM"
- **Scheduled jobs** — Run specific prompts on a cron schedule

Each cron job runs in its own session, independent of the main conversation.

## Nodes

The `nodes` tool controls **paired devices** (phones, tablets, other computers):

- **camera_snap** / **camera_clip** — Take photos or video clips from device cameras
- **screen_record** — Record the device screen
- **location_get** — Get the device's current location
- **run** — Execute commands on the device
- **notify** — Send notifications to the device

## Tool Policies

Tool policies control which tools are available to a claw. Configure them in your gateway config:

### Allow / Deny Lists

```yaml
tools:
  allow:
    - read
    - write
    - edit
    - exec
  # OR
  deny:
    - browser
    - nodes
```

### Tool Profiles

Profiles are preset allowlists for common use cases:

| Profile | Tools Included |
|---------|---------------|
| `minimal` | File system tools only |
| `coding` | File system, runtime, web |
| `messaging` | File system, messaging, sessions |
| `full` | All tools enabled |

```yaml
tools:
  profile: coding
```

### Per-Agent Overrides

Different agents can have different tool access:

```yaml
agents:
  coding-bot:
    tools:
      profile: coding
  social-bot:
    tools:
      profile: messaging
      allow:
        - web_search
```

## TOOLS.md

Each claw has a `TOOLS.md` file in its workspace for storing local notes about tool usage — API keys, device names, project-specific commands, and other configuration that helps the claw use its tools effectively. This file is maintained by the claw itself and loaded at the start of each session.
