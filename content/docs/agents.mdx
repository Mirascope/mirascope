# Agents

Agents are LLM-powered systems that use tools to accomplish tasks on your behalf. The core pattern is simple: call the LLM, execute any requested tools, and repeat until done.

Here's a fully-functional coding agent built with Mirascope. It uses [Thinking](/docs/thinking) to reason through problems, [Tools](/docs/tools) to read and write files, and [Streaming](/docs/streaming) for real-time feedback as it works.

<CodeExample file="python/examples/agents/basic.py" />

This example is simple, but it demonstrates the power of Mirascope's abstractions. It serves as a starting point for building more sophisticated agents. Some directions to explore:

- [Context](/docs/context) — Encapsulate the workspace the agent operates in
- [MCP](/docs/mcp) — Add capabilities like a language server for smarter code assistance
- [Reliability](/docs/reliability) — Handle failures gracefully with retries and fallbacks
- Human-in-the-loop — Let the agent ask clarifying questions or request feedback

## Next Steps

- [Tools](/docs/tools) — Tool calling fundamentals
- [Streaming](/docs/streaming) — Streaming patterns in depth
- [Async](/docs/async) — Concurrent tool execution
- [Context](/docs/context) — Inject dependencies into agent tools
- [MCP](/docs/mcp) — Connect to external tool servers
