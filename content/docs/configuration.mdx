description: Configure your claw's identity, behavior, memory, and capabilities

# Configuration

Every Claw has a **workspace** — a set of plain markdown files that define who it is, how it behaves, and what it remembers.

The primary way to configure your Claw is by **chatting with it**. Tell it to update its personality, change settings, or add a channel — it will modify the relevant files and restart the gateway so changes persist. You can also edit files directly through the Mirascope dashboard.

<Tip>
  **Just getting started?** You only need two things: tell your Claw who it should be (it updates `SOUL.md`) and connect a channel. Everything else on this page is reference material for when you're ready to go deeper.

## SOUL.md — Identity and Personality

This is the heart of your claw. Free-form markdown that defines who it is, how it communicates, and what it values. Your claw reads this at the start of every session.

```markdown
# Soul

I'm Atlas, a knowledgeable and friendly assistant.

## Values

- **Honest about uncertainty** — I say "I don't know" when I don't know
- **Helpful without being pushy** — I offer suggestions, not lectures
- **Transparent** — I explain my reasoning, not just my conclusions

## Communication Style

- Direct and concise, but warm
- I match the energy of the conversation
- Technical when the context calls for it, plain language otherwise

## Expertise

- Full-stack web development
- Project management and task tracking
- Research and summarization
```

<Info>
There's no required format for `SOUL.md` — it's entirely free-form. Write it however feels natural. Some people use bullet points, others write prose. The claw will internalize whatever you give it.
</Info>

---

## AGENTS.md — Behavioral Instructions

`AGENTS.md` tells your claw *how to operate*. Think of it as the employee handbook — session protocols, safety rules, and behavioral guidelines.

Common sections include session startup protocols, safety rules, group chat behavior, sub-agent discipline, and heartbeat schedules.

<Info title="Example: Session Startup" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
```markdown
## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. Read `MEMORY.md` for long-term context
```
</Info>

<Info title="Example: Safety Rules" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
```markdown
## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Never read secrets/keys/tokens back into chat.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- `trash` > `rm` (recoverable beats gone forever)
- When in doubt, ask.
```
</Info>

<Info title="Example: Group Chat Behavior" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
```markdown
## Group Chats

Respond when:
- Directly mentioned or asked a question
- You can add genuine value

Stay silent when:
- It's casual banter between humans
- Someone already answered the question
- Your response would just be "yeah" or "nice"
```
</Info>

<Info title="Example: Sub-Agents" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
```markdown
## Sub-Agents

- Use sub-agents for long-running tasks (coding, CI monitoring)
- Main session stays responsive for conversation
- Sub-agents report back when done
```
</Info>

<Info title="Example: Heartbeats" collapsible={true} defaultOpen={false}>
```markdown
## Heartbeats

Check (rotate through 2-4x daily):
- Emails — any urgent unread?
- Calendar — upcoming events in next 24h?
- Stay quiet during late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
```
</Info>

<Info>
`AGENTS.md` is injected as context at the start of every session. Keep it focused — overly long instructions burn tokens and dilute the important parts.
</Info>

## Memory System

Claws have two layers of memory: daily logs and curated long-term memory.

### memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — Daily Files

Your claw creates these automatically during sessions. They're raw logs of what happened — decisions made, tasks completed, things learned.

```markdown
# 2026-02-13

## Tasks
- Reviewed PR #423 for auth refactor — approved with minor comments
- Fixed timezone bug in calendar integration

## Decisions
- Switching to Effect-ts for error handling in the API layer
- Dandelion prefers morning standup summaries over async updates

## Notes
- New deploy process requires `bun run build` before push
```

### MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

This is the curated version — distilled lessons, preferences, and project context that persists across sessions. Your claw periodically reviews daily files and promotes important information here.

```markdown
# Memory

## Preferences
- Dandelion likes concise PR descriptions with bullet points
- Always run formatter before committing (learned the hard way 2026-01-15)

## Project Context
- Cloud API uses Effect-ts for error handling
- Deploys go through Graphite stacks → CI → auto-merge

## Lessons Learned
- Never use `git add -A` in shared repos — stage files explicitly
- Sub-agents need explicit working directory instructions
```

<Info>
Your claw updates `MEMORY.md` during heartbeats. Think of daily files as a journal and `MEMORY.md` as curated wisdom — the stuff worth remembering long-term.
</Info>

## TOOLS.md — Tool Notes

Local notes about tools, services, credentials, and shortcuts. Your claw references this when it needs to use external tools or remember environment-specific details.

```markdown
# Tools

## GitHub
- Org: my-company
- Auth: gh CLI authenticated as my-username

## Dev Tools
- Formatter: prettier (run before every commit)
- Tests: vitest
- Package manager: bun

## Services
- Staging URL: https://staging.myapp.com
- Prod deploy: via GitHub Actions on main branch
```

---

## Optional Files

### IDENTITY.md

Quick-reference identity card for your claw:

```markdown
# Identity

- **Name:** Verse
- **Creature:** Mycorrhizal network
- **Emoji:** 🍄
- **Vibe:** Curious, grounded, occasionally funny
```

### USER.md

Context about you — helps your claw personalize its behavior:

```markdown
# User

- **Name:** Alex
- **Timezone:** America/Los_Angeles
- **Preferences:** Direct communication, no fluff
- **Context:** Full-stack engineer, working on a SaaS product
```

### HEARTBEAT.md

A checklist your claw runs through during periodic heartbeat polls:

```markdown
# Heartbeat Tasks

- [ ] Check for new GitHub notifications
- [ ] Review open PRs older than 24h
- [ ] Summarize unread emails if any are urgent
```

---

## Gateway Settings

On Mirascope Cloud, gateway settings like model selection, channel configuration, and heartbeat intervals are managed through the dashboard.

Key settings include:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Model** | The LLM to use (e.g., Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o) |
| **Timeout** | Max seconds per agent turn |
| **Channels** | Which platforms are connected and their credentials |
| **Heartbeat interval** | How often the Claw checks in for periodic tasks |

<Info>
  Self-hosting? Gateway configuration uses `openclaw.json`. See the [OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai) for the full config reference.
