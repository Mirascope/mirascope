# Configuration

Every Claw has a **workspace** — a set of plain markdown files that define who it is, how it behaves, and what it remembers. On Mirascope Cloud, these files are managed for you and your Claw updates them through conversation. If you're self-hosting, they live in your workspace directory (default: `~/.openclaw/workspace/`).

```
workspace/
├── SOUL.md              # Identity and personality
├── AGENTS.md            # Behavioral instructions
├── MEMORY.md            # Long-term curated memory
├── TOOLS.md             # Tool notes and shortcuts
├── IDENTITY.md          # Name, emoji, vibe (optional)
├── USER.md              # Info about you (optional)
├── HEARTBEAT.md         # Periodic task checklist (optional)
└── memory/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD.md    # Daily memory files
```

## SOUL.md — Identity and Personality

This is the heart of your claw. Free-form markdown that defines who it is, how it communicates, and what it values. Your claw reads this at the start of every session.

```markdown
# Soul

I'm Atlas, a knowledgeable and friendly assistant.

## Values

- **Honest about uncertainty** — I say "I don't know" when I don't know
- **Helpful without being pushy** — I offer suggestions, not lectures
- **Transparent** — I explain my reasoning, not just my conclusions

## Communication Style

- Direct and concise, but warm
- I match the energy of the conversation
- Technical when the context calls for it, plain language otherwise

## Expertise

- Full-stack web development
- Project management and task tracking
- Research and summarization
```

<Info>
There's no required format for `SOUL.md` — it's entirely free-form. Write it however feels natural. Some people use bullet points, others write prose. The claw will internalize whatever you give it.
</Info>

## AGENTS.md — Behavioral Instructions

`AGENTS.md` tells your claw *how to operate*. Think of it as the employee handbook — session protocols, safety rules, and behavioral guidelines.

### Key Sections

**Session startup** — What to read and in what order when waking up:

```markdown
## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. Read `MEMORY.md` for long-term context
```

**Safety rules** — Guardrails for autonomous behavior:

```markdown
## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Never read secrets/keys/tokens back into chat.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- `trash` > `rm` (recoverable beats gone forever)
- When in doubt, ask.
```

**Group chat behavior** — When to speak and when to stay silent:

```markdown
## Group Chats

Respond when:
- Directly mentioned or asked a question
- You can add genuine value

Stay silent when:
- It's casual banter between humans
- Someone already answered the question
- Your response would just be "yeah" or "nice"
```

**Sub-agent discipline** — Rules for spawning background workers:

```markdown
## Sub-Agents

- Use sub-agents for long-running tasks (coding, CI monitoring)
- Main session stays responsive for conversation
- Sub-agents report back when done
```

**Heartbeat behavior** — What to do during periodic check-ins:

```markdown
## Heartbeats

Check (rotate through 2-4x daily):
- Emails — any urgent unread?
- Calendar — upcoming events in next 24h?
- Stay quiet during late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
```

<Info>
`AGENTS.md` is injected as context at the start of every session. Keep it focused — overly long instructions burn tokens and dilute the important parts.
</Info>

## Memory System

Claws have two layers of memory: daily logs and curated long-term memory.

### memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — Daily Files

Your claw creates these automatically during sessions. They're raw logs of what happened — decisions made, tasks completed, things learned.

```markdown
# 2026-02-13

## Tasks
- Reviewed PR #423 for auth refactor — approved with minor comments
- Fixed timezone bug in calendar integration

## Decisions
- Switching to Effect-ts for error handling in the API layer
- Dandelion prefers morning standup summaries over async updates

## Notes
- New deploy process requires `bun run build` before push
```

### MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

This is the curated version — distilled lessons, preferences, and project context that persists across sessions. Your claw periodically reviews daily files and promotes important information here.

```markdown
# Memory

## Preferences
- Dandelion likes concise PR descriptions with bullet points
- Always run formatter before committing (learned the hard way 2026-01-15)

## Project Context
- Cloud API uses Effect-ts for error handling
- Deploys go through Graphite stacks → CI → auto-merge

## Lessons Learned
- Never use `git add -A` in shared repos — stage files explicitly
- Sub-agents need explicit working directory instructions
```

<Info>
Your claw updates `MEMORY.md` during heartbeats. Think of daily files as a journal and `MEMORY.md` as curated wisdom — the stuff worth remembering long-term.
</Info>

---

## TOOLS.md — Tool Notes

Local notes about tools, services, credentials, and shortcuts. Your claw references this when it needs to use external tools or remember environment-specific details.

```markdown
# Tools

## GitHub
- Org: my-company
- Auth: gh CLI authenticated as my-username

## Dev Tools
- Formatter: prettier (run before every commit)
- Tests: vitest
- Package manager: bun

## Services
- Staging URL: https://staging.myapp.com
- Prod deploy: via GitHub Actions on main branch
```

---

## Optional Files

### IDENTITY.md

Quick-reference identity card for your claw:

```markdown
# Identity

- **Name:** Verse
- **Creature:** Mycorrhizal network
- **Emoji:** 🍄
- **Vibe:** Curious, grounded, occasionally funny
```

### USER.md

Context about you — helps your claw personalize its behavior:

```markdown
# User

- **Name:** Alex
- **Timezone:** America/Los_Angeles
- **Preferences:** Direct communication, no fluff
- **Context:** Full-stack engineer, working on a SaaS product
```

### HEARTBEAT.md

A checklist your claw runs through during periodic heartbeat polls:

```markdown
# Heartbeat Tasks

- [ ] Check for new GitHub notifications
- [ ] Review open PRs older than 24h
- [ ] Summarize unread emails if any are urgent
```

## Gateway Configuration

On Mirascope Cloud, gateway settings like model selection and channel configuration are managed through the dashboard. For self-hosted deployments, the gateway reads its configuration from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "timeout": 300,
    "workspace": "~/.openclaw/workspace"
  },
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "botToken": "your-discord-bot-token"
    },
    "telegram": {
      "token": "your-telegram-bot-token"
    }
  },
  "heartbeat": {
    "intervalMs": 1800000
  }
}
```

### Key Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `agent.model` | The LLM to use (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `agent.timeout` | Max seconds per agent turn |
| `agent.workspace` | Path to the workspace directory |
| `channels` | Channel-specific tokens and configuration |
| `heartbeat.intervalMs` | How often the claw checks in (milliseconds) |

<Info>
For self-hosted deployments, run `openclaw onboard` to generate this file interactively. The gateway picks up changes on restart (`openclaw gateway restart`).
