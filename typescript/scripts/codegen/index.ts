/**
 * Code generation scripts for TypeScript model info.
 *
 * This module generates TypeScript model info files from YAML test data.
 * The YAML data is generated by Python test scripts in python/scripts/model_features/
 * that test actual API features for each model.
 *
 * WHY DUPLICATE CODEGEN IN BOTH LANGUAGES?
 * ----------------------------------------
 * The Python SDK has its own codegen scripts (python/scripts/model_features/codegen_*.py)
 * that generate Python model info files. We maintain a separate TypeScript implementation
 * rather than having Python generate TypeScript code because:
 *
 * 1. Tooling isolation - Each SDK manages its own code generation with native tools
 *    (Python uses uv/venv, TypeScript uses bun)
 * 2. Developer experience - TypeScript developers can run codegen without Python
 * 3. The YAML data files are the shared source of truth, not the codegen logic
 * 4. Eventually, TypeScript may have its own test scripts to generate YAML data
 *
 * The YAML files at python/scripts/model_features/data/*.yaml are the interface
 * between the test infrastructure and the codegen scripts.
