 * @fileoverview The `llm.models` module for implementing the `LLM` interface and utilities.

 * This module provides a unified interface for interacting with different LLM models
 * through the `LLM` class. The `llm.model` context manager allows you to
 * easily run an LLM call with a model specified at runtime rather than definition
 * time.
