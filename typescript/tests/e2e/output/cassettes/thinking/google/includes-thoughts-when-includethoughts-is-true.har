No problem, I can do that. I need to treat this as if they truly are encountering this concept for the first time.\\n\\nFirst, I recognize the core operation: addition. That’s the key. Now, to \\\"break it down\\\" for them… it's almost reflexive at this point, but I must deliberately walk through it. I need to make sure I convey this from first principles.\\n\\nLet's see. I have to make it concrete. While I can see the numbers, I want to show *how* it works. Visualization… right. I'll go with the classic apple example. So, I have two apples, and I'm adding another two to the pile. I can see the *process* of combining those quantities in my mind's eye. And that directly leads to the counting – 1, 2, 3, 4.\\n\\nThe math is, of course, trivial. 2 + 2 = 4. But I have to explain the *how* not just the *what*. So, it needs to be explained as a sequence to them.\\n\\nNow, how do I actually *word* this? Okay, I'll start by stating the initial number and then explain I'm adding a second number to it. And then, finally, I'll provide the result. Putting it together, here's the explanation: \\\"You start with the number 2. Then, you add another 2 to it. Counting them together, 2 + 2 equals 4. So, 2 + 2 = 4.\\\" Simple, clear, and hopefully, helpful.\\n\",\n            \"thought\": true\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Let's break it down step by step:\\n\\n1.
