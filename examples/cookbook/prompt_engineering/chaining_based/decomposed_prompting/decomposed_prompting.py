    Your job is to break a problem into subproblems so that it may be solved step by step, using at most one function call at each step.

    You have access to the following functions which you can use to solve a problem:
    split: split a string into individual words
    substring: get the ith character of a single string.
    concat: concatenate some number of strings.

    Here is an example of how it would be done for the problem:
    Get the first two letters of the phrase 'Round Robin' with a period and space in between them.
    Steps:
    split 'Round Robin' into individual words
    substring the 0th char of 'Round'
    substring the 0th char of 'Robin'
    concat ['R', '.', ' ', 'R']

    Now, turn this problem into subtasks:
