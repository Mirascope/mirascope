# MAX SCORE:4
# Solution:
# Let's break down the problem step by step.

# 1. **Determine the total amount of lemonade needed:**
#    - Tim originally planned to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
#    - Allen asked for an extra gallon, making the total amount of lemonade:
#      \[
#      4 \text{ gallons} + 1 \text{ gallon} = 5 \text{ gallons}
#      \]

# 2. **Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for 5 gallons:**
#    - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
#    - Therefore, for 5 gallons, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:
#      \[
#      5 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
#      \]

# 3. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra tart gallon:**
#    - Allen's gallon is twice as tart as the others. This means it will require double the amount of lemon juice.
#    - Therefore, for the extra gallon, the amount of lemon juice needed is:
#      \[
#      1 \text{ cup} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
#      \]

# 4. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
#    - For the 4 gallons, Tim needs 4 cups of lemon juice (1 cup each).
#    - For the extra tart gallon, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice.
#    - Thus, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:
#      \[
#      4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
#      \]

# 5. **Determine how many lemons are needed to make 6 cups of lemon juice:**
#    - From the information given, 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
#    - To find out how many lemons are needed for 6 cups, we calculate:
#      \[
#      6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 6 \text{ cups} = 36 \text{ lemons}
#      \]

# So, Tim will need a total of **36 lemons** to make the lemonade for the pool party, including the extra tart gallon for Allen.
# Score:
# 0

# Solution:
# Let's go through the problem step by step.

# 1. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.**
#    - According to Tim's recipe, 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
#    - For 4 gallons, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:
#      \[
#      4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
#      \]

# 2. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.**
#    - Tim found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
#    - To find out how many lemons are needed for 4 cups of juice, we first determine how many cups of juice can be obtained from 6 lemons:
#      \[
#      6 \text{ lemons} \rightarrow 1 \text{ cup}
#      \]
#    - Therefore, for 4 cups of juice, the number of lemons required is:
#      \[
#      4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}
#      \]

# 3. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart.**
#    - Since the extra gallon is supposed to be twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.
#    - Therefore, for the extra gallon:
#      \[
#      1 \text{ gallon} \times 2 \text{ cups/gallon} = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
#      \]

# 4. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon.**
#    - Using the same conversion as before (6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice), we find out how many lemons are needed for 2 cups of juice:
#      \[
#      2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
#      \]

# 5. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed.**
#    - Now, we can find the total number of lemons needed for both the 4 gallons of lemonade and the extra gallon:
#      \[
#      24 \text{ lemons (for 4 gallons)} + 12 \text{ lemons (for extra gallon)} = 36 \text{ lemons}
#      \]

# Thus, Tim will need a total of **36 lemons** to make the lemonade for the pool party and the extra tart gallon for Allen.
# Score:
# 4

# Solution:
# Let's break this down step by step to determine how many lemons Tim will need.

# ### Step 1: Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.

# The recipe calls for **1 cup of fresh lemon juice** for **1 gallon of lemonade**. Therefore, for **4 gallons**, Tim will need:

# \[
# 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
# \]

# ### Step 2: Calculate the lemon juice needed for Allen's extra gallon.

# Allen wants an extra gallon that is **twice as tart**. To make it twice as tart, Tim will need **2 cups of lemon juice** for that gallon (since the standard recipe uses 1 cup for 1 gallon).

# ### Step 3: Find the total amount of lemon juice needed.

# Now, we add the lemon juice needed for both Tim's and Allen's lemonade:

# \[
# 4 \text{ cups (for 4 gallons)} + 2 \text{ cups (for Allen's extra gallon)} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
# \]

# ### Step 4: Determine how many lemons are needed to yield 6 cups of juice.

# We know that **6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice**. To find out how many lemons are needed for **6 cups of juice**, we can set up the following calculation:

# \[
# \text{Number of lemons} = 6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 6 \text{ cups} = 36 \text{ lemons}
# \]

# ### Conclusion

# Tim will need **36 lemons** to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart.
# Score:
# 0
