#   3. Minimize distractions by turning off notifications, finding a quiet workspace, and setting boundaries with others.
#   4. Taking regular breaks throughout the day can help improve focus by giving your mind a chance to rest and rejuvenate, allowing you to come back to your tasks with renewed energy and clarity.
