# To find out how much money Olivia has left after buying the bagels, we can follow these steps:

# 1. **Determine the total cost of the bagels**: Olivia bought 5 bagels, and each bagel costs $3.
#    - Total cost = Number of bagels × Cost per bagel
#    - Total cost = 5 × 3 = $15

# 2. **Subtract the total cost from Olivia's initial amount**: Olivia started with $23, and we need to subtract the total cost of the bagels from this amount.
#    - Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
#    - Money left = 23 - 15 = $8

# Therefore, Olivia has $8 left after buying the bagels. The answer is $8.
# To find out how much money Olivia has left after buying the bagels, we can follow these steps:

# 1. **Determine the cost of the bagels**: Olivia bought 5 bagels, and each bagel costs $3. So, we calculate the total cost:
#    \[
#    \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
#    \]

# 2. **Calculate how much money Olivia has left**: Olivia started with $23. After spending $15 on the bagels, we subtract the cost from her initial amount:
#    \[
#    \text{Money left} = 23 - 15 = 8 \text{ dollars}
#    \]

# Therefore, Olivia has $8 left. The answer is 8.

# 3. **Conclusion**: After buying the bagels, Olivia has $8 left.

# The answer is $8.
# To find out how much money Olivia has left after buying the bagels, let's go through the steps:

# 1. **Determine how much Olivia spent on the bagels.**
#    Olivia bought 5 bagels for $3 each.
#    To find the total cost of the bagels, we multiply the number of bagels by the price per bagel:
#    \[
#    5 \text{ bagels} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bagel} = 15 \text{ dollars}
#    \]

# 2. **Calculate how much money Olivia has left after the purchase.**
#    Olivia started with $23 and spent $15 on the bagels.
#    To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount spent from her initial amount:
#    \[
#    23 \text{ dollars} - 15 \text{ dollars} = 8 \text{ dollars}
