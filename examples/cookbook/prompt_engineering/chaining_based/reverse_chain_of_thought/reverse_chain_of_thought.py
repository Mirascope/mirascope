# ### Problem Prompt:

# At a county level scavenger hunt competition, there are 90 people who need to be split into smaller groups to begin the competition. For this purpose, 9-person groups are formed. If \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the formed groups had their members each bring back 2 seashells, how many seashells were brought back in total?

# ### Solution Steps:

# 1. **Determine the number of groups formed:**
#    - Total people = 90
#    - Each group consists of 9 people.
#    \[
#    \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
#    \]

# 2. **Determine how many groups brought back seashells:**
#    - \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the formed groups brought back seashells.
#    \[
#    \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
#    \]

# 3. **Calculate the total number of members in these groups:**
#    - Each of these 6 groups consists of 9 members.
#    \[
#    \text{Total members} = 6 \times 9 = 54
#    \]

# 4. **Calculate the total number of seashells:**
#    - Each member of these groups brought back 2 seashells.
#    \[
#    \text{Total seashells} = 54 \times 2 = 108
#    \]

# Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is **108 seashells**.

# Intermediate Steps

# aggregate prompt fed into final call:
# Here are the mistakes and reasons in your answer to the problem.


#             Overlooked Conditions:
#             You have ignored some real conditions:
#             ['There are 90 people who need to be split into groups.', 'Each member of the qualifying groups brought back 2 seashells.']
#             The real problem has the conditions:
#             ['There are 90 people who need to be split into groups.', 'Each group consists of 9 people.', 'Calculate the number of groups formed.', '3/5 of the groups had members who brought back seashells.', 'Each member of the qualifying groups brought back 2 seashells.']
#             You should consider all real conditions in the problem.
#             Here are the detailed reasons:
#             ["The candidate condition refers specifically to '90 people that need to be split into groups', which cannot be directly deduced as the conditions only mention '90 students' without specifying a need for division into groups.", "The candidate condition states 'Each member of the qualifying groups brought back 2 seashells.', which implies that every individual within those groups brought back the seashells. However, the condition list states 'Each student in those groups brought back 2 seashells.', which refers specifically to students. Since the term 'members of the qualifying groups' could include non-students, we cannot deduce that it is true for all members."]

#             Hallucinated Conditions
#             You use some wrong candidate conditions:
#             ['There are 90 students.']
#             They all can not be deduced from the true condition list.
#             The real problem has the conditions:

#             You misunderstood the question.
#             You think the question is: **Problem Prompt:**

# A school organizes a field trip with 90 students, where they are divided into groups of 9. After the trip, it is found that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each brought back seashells. If each student in those groups brought back 2 seashells, how many seashells were brought back in total?.
#             But the real question is: At the trip to the county level scavenger hunt competition 90 people
# were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break
# people up into smaller groups with different leaders 9-person groups were
# formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each
# how many seashells did they bring?
#             They are different. You should consider the original question.
# Thank you for your feedback. Based on your comments, I understand that the original problem requires clarity and that I should adhere strictly to the specified conditions. Here is a properly defined problem that incorporates all necessary details and leads to the answer.
