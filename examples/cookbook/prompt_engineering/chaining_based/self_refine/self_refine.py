# Intermediate Responses
# response = call(query).content
# Olivia bought five bagels for $3 each. The total cost of the bagels can be calculated as follows:

# Total cost = Number of bagels × Cost per bagel
# Total cost = 5 × 3 = $15

# Now, we subtract the total cost from Olivia's initial amount of money:

# Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
# Money left = $23 - $15 = $8

# So, Olivia has $8 left.

# feedback = evaluate_response(query, response)
# The response to the query is correct in its calculations and reasoning. Here are the points of feedback:

# **Correct Aspects:**
# 1. **Accurate Calculation of Total Cost**: The response correctly identifies that Olivia bought five bagels for $3 each and calculates the total cost as $15 using the formula: Total cost = Number of bagels × Cost per bagel.
# 2. **Correct Subtraction**: The response accurately subtracts the total cost ($15) from Olivia's initial amount ($23) to find the remaining money, resulting in $8.
# 3. **Clear Structure**: The response is well-structured, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations, which makes it easy to follow.

# **Areas for Improvement:**
# - **Clarifying the Context**: While the answer is mathematically correct, adding a brief context or summary at the end ("So, after her purchase of bagels, Olivia has $8 left") would reinforce the conclusion.

# Overall, the response is well done and effectively addresses the query. There are no significant errors, and it demonstrates clarity in problem-solving.
