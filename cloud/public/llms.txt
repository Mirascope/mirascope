# Mirascope Documentation - Markdown Access

This document explains how to access Mirascope documentation in markdown format.

## Markdown Files

All documentation pages have a corresponding markdown file available. To access the markdown version of any page, append `.md` to the URL path.

### URL Pattern

```
HTML:     https://mirascope.com/docs/learn/llm/calls
Markdown: https://mirascope.com/docs/learn/llm/calls.md
```

### Example

```bash
# Fetch markdown directly
curl https://mirascope.com/docs/learn/llm/calls.md
```

## Sitemap

The complete list of all pages is available at:
https://mirascope.com/sitemap.xml

To get markdown URLs from the sitemap, append `.md` to each page URL.

## Content Structure

- `/docs/` - SDK Documentation
  - `/docs/learn/` - Learning guides and tutorials
  - `/docs/api/` - API reference
- `/blog/` - Blog posts and announcements

## Markdown Format

Each markdown file includes:
- YAML frontmatter with title, description, and canonical URL
- Full content with code examples expanded
- Absolute URLs for all links and images

## Recommended Approach for Programmatic Access

1. Fetch the sitemap to discover all available pages
2. Filter for pages under `/docs/` for documentation
3. Append `/index.md` to each URL to get the markdown version
4. Fetch each markdown file

## Rate Limiting
