# Self Hosting

<Warning title="Lilypad self hosting is currently in a closed beta.">
  The Free version is available for self hosting with community support. Pro and Team plan features are available for beta testing upon request.

  Interested in participating in the closed beta? [Join our community](https://mirascope.com/discord-invite) and send a message to William Bakst. If we determine it's a good fit, you'll get early access to Pro and Team plan features when self hosting.
</Warning>

Lilypad is fully [open-source](/docs/lilypad/open-source) and can be self-hosted in your own infrastructure.

You can also run Lilypad on your local machine.

### Requirements:

To self-host Lilypad, you'll need:

1. Python 3.10+
2. Bun
3. PostgreSQL
4. A GitHub or Google account (for authentication)
5. Docker

<Info>
  In the following sections we will be using `http://localhost:8000` as the host/port URL.
  
  Replace this with the URL where you are ultimately hosting Lilypad and making it accessible.
</Info>

## Setup

First, you'll need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mirascope/lilypad.git
cd lilypad/app
```

Next, you'll need to install `uv` and the package's dependencies:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync --all-extras
```

Last, create a `.env` file where you'll store all of the upcoming environment variables.

## Authentication

First, you'll need to generate and set a JWT secret. For example:

```bash
bun -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

Then set it in your environment:

```bash
LILYPAD_JWT_SECRET=...
```

Next, you'll need to set up OAuth 2.0 Authentication. You can choose between GitHub or Google:

- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- Authorization Callback URL: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`

### GitHub

To authenticate with GitHub, create a new [OAuth app on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) and set the following environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
LILYPAD_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

### Google

To authenticate with Google, create a new [OAuth app on Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) and set the following environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
LILYPAD_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

## Client

First, set your environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_API_SERVE_FRONTEND=true
```

You can optionally set `LILYPAD_CLIENT_BASE_URL` to the URL where you're hosting the client separately. In this case, you would set `LILYPAD_API_SERVE_FRONTEND=false`.

Now, build the client:

```bash
cd client
touch .env
echo "VITE_REMOTE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/v0" > .env
bun i
bun run build
cd ..
```

## Server

Set the remote API and client URLs so the server knows where to route everything:

```bash
LILYPAD_REMOTE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
LILYPAD_REMOTE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Whether you're running this locally or hosted in the cloud, you'll need to build the image:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t lilypad .
```

## Local

You can use Docker Compose to run everything together locally:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

<Warning>
  You must update `docker-compose.yml` to match your `.env` setup.
</Warning>

You should now be able to access your Lilypad instance at `http://localhost:8000`.

Note that spinning down the container will not result in a loss of data, as the database is persisted in a volume.

## Hosted

You'll need to set up a PostgreSQL database and set the following environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_DB_HOST=...
LILYPAD_DB_NAME=...
LILYPAD_DB_PASSWORD=...
LILYPAD_DB_PORT=...
LILYPAD_DB_USER=...
```

Now you can run the server:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env lilypad
```

You should now be able to access your Lilypad instance at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Application

In your LLM code that uses Lilypad, you'll need to set the API and client URLs so that your code points to your self-hosted instance:

```bash
LILYPAD_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v0
LILYPAD_REMOTE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Now you can use Lilypad as [documented](/docs/lilypad/getting-started/quickstart).

<Warning title="Make sure to install the correct package version.">
  The production-stable latest release of the SDK on PyPI may not be the same version as the one you're self-hosting. Make sure to install the version that matches your self-hosted instance.
</Warning>
