Langfuse is a favorite among AI developers because it lets you trace user prompts, model responses, and system performance in one place. It also supports self-hosting, giving you full control over your data and how everything runs, with zero vendor lock-in.

Even so, there are a few things that make some devs look elsewhere:

* Setting up self-hosting can be complex because it depends on services like ClickHouse, Redis, and S3.  
* Even after setup, keeping it running smoothly takes some effort; if events don’t show up in the UI, you may need to dig through logs and storage layers to find out why.  
* Some users report the interface can feel cluttered or hard to follow.  
* It versions the prompt and some configuration parameters, but not the surrounding code context, so it might not suit workflows where prompts and logic are tightly coupled.

In this article, we cover 6 top alternatives to Langfuse, including Lilypad, our open-source platform built for developers. Unlike tools that only version prompts, Lilypad versions your entire function, so you can track logic, not just text. 

It also includes built-in OpenTelemetry for tracking cost and latency, along with easy annotations and side-by-side version comparisons.

Below we take a closer look at each option and what it brings to the table.

## 1. Lilypad: The Developer’s Framework for Reproducible LLM Workflows

![Lilypad Homepage](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/lilypad-homepage.webp)

[Lilypad](/docs/lilypad) is a user-friendly open source prompt engineering framework. Unlike other solutions that focus only on the prompt text, Lilypad treats every LLM call as a complete software artifact, capturing the entire context that influences the output.

With Lilypad, you get:

* Automatic capture of traces, inputs/outputs, cost, and latency for every LLM call with zero configuration.  
* Automatic versioning of your prompts as you make changes; no manual commits needed.  
* Full versioning of everything that influences LLM output quality, including the surrounding code, not just the text prompt.  
* Easy and lightweight self-hosting options for developers wanting a fast local setup or minimal cloud deployment, avoiding the complexity of distributed storage and parallel services.

Below, we explain how Lilypad works:

### Trace Everything From the First Line of Code

LLM outputs are non-deterministic, which is why it's important to take a snapshot of the exact version of the code that was used to produce an output. This reproducibility is necessary for proper [LLM evaluation](/blog/llm-evaluation).

Tools that version only the raw prompt text are missing crucial context. With LLMs, the output isn't just shaped by the prompt; it's the result of a blend of:

* The control flow or logic of how the model is queried.  
* Call parameters like `model`, `temperature`, `top_p`, or `max_tokens`.  
* Pre- and post-processing such as how inputs are prepared or outputs interpreted.  
* Surrounding code like helper functions, embedded data, or state from other parts of your system.

Even a minor change to model settings, input structure, or surrounding logic can alter the outcome, so if you're only versioning the prompt, you lose the ability to reproduce results, understand why something worked, or pinpoint what went wrong when it doesn't.

Lilypad solves this by versioning the entire function closure, which is a full snapshot of everything that influenced the output, not just the prompt string. It treats LLM calls as proper software artifacts that are trackable, reproducible, and safe to iterate on.

It also encourages developers to encapsulate LLM calls in Python functions so that every aspect of the interaction, including the prompt, inputs, model settings, and any surrounding logic, can be versioned, traced, and evaluated as a single, reproducible unit.

Just use `@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")` on your call functions to automatically capture arguments, return values, and internal changes within the function closure:

```python
import lilypad
from mirascope import llm

@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")  # [!code highlight]
@llm.call(provider="google", model="gemini-2.0-flash-001")
def answer_question(question: str) -> str:
    return f"Answer this question: {question}"

response = answer_question("What is the capital of France?")    
print(response)
# > The capital of France is Paris. 
```

The results are shown in Lilypad's Traces tab. If you're using a Mirascope LLM call, the versioned function will also be available in the playground (explained in the next section), which allows you to delegate prompt editing and evals to domain experts.

When the code above is first run, it creates a nested trace and is logged as version 1:

![Answer Question V1 Trace](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/answer-question-v1-trace.webp)

Changing anything in the function or the prompt and then running the code again automatically produces version 2:

![Answer Question V2 Trace](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/answer-question-v2-trace.webp)

Note that if you change a function so that it's identical to any previous version, the version isn't incremented.

You can also compare function versions by clicking the “Compare” button:

![Answer Question Click Compare](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/answer-question-click-compare.webp)

This toggles a second dropdown menu, where you can select another version and view the differences side-by-side.

![Answer Question Compare Versions](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/answer-question-compare-versions.webp)

Lilypad also supports A/B testing and rollbacks, since every function run creates a trace with metadata. 

Accessing any version using `.version(n)()`  allows you to compare it with another, you can use it in statements like:

```python
response = answer_question.version(2)("What is Saturn's largest moon?") 
```

This allows you to run different versions of the same function and it makes A/B testing convenient. Just run each version for a subset of users and evaluate which one is better.

### No-Code Prompt Experimentation for SMEs

Lilypad’s playground provides a no-code browser environment and safe collaboration model that gives domain experts the ability to create, change, and hot swap prompts without involvement from developers so they don't need to redeploy the code.

Prompt changes in the playground are sandboxed by default:

* They don’t affect live code unless deliberately synced by an engineer.  
* Running a prompt in the playground doesn't require a pull request, merge, or redeploy.  
* Outputs are recorded and versioned, just like any code-executed trace.  
* Annotations, discussions, and comparisons are linked directly to runs.

The playground supports type-safe prompt templates, letting you write markdown-style prompts with embedded, typed variable placeholders.

 The templates:

* Are mapped to function signatures for strong typing and reproducibility.  
* Are backed by a Python function with type-safe arguments (the system ensures that inputs provided in the playground match the function's schema).  
* Prevent injection bugs, missing parameters, or incorrect input formats.

Lilypad keeps your prompts and code working together with no brittleness. While other [LLM tools](/blog/llm-tools) split prompts off into separate systems, Lilypad versions the whole function so that what you test in the playground is the same code you use in production. Even if Lilypad goes down, your code will still run.

Each time an [LLM prompt](/blog/llm-prompt) is run in the playground, Lilypad captures a full trace, just like it does for production code. This trace includes all inputs, outputs, call settings, model metadata, and any annotations or labels. The result is a transparent, inspectable snapshot of that exact run.

You can review it in the Traces tab, where each span is timestamped, costed, and ready to annotate or compare:

![Answer Question GenAI Data](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/answer-question-genai-data.webp)

Lilypad uses the [OpenTelemetry Gen AI spec](https://opentelemetry.io/) to trace every LLM call with standardized, structured metadata, making your runs easy to debug, visualize, and analyze across tools. Playground users can also quickly annotate traces, adding pass/fail labels, reasoning, and comments, right from the trace viewer, as we’ll see in the next section.

### Evaluating LLM Outputs

LLMs’ non-determinism makes traditional unit tests a poor fit. Evaluation isn’t a one-and-done task: it’s an ongoing process, constantly evolving as new edge cases emerge. What counts as a “correct” output is often contextual and relies on human judgment, rather than being a simple binary right-or-wrong decision.

Fuzzy metrics work best, especially pass/fail labels, which offer a clear, actionable signal. Overly granular scoring systems like one to five stars tend to reduce clarity and consistency, adding noise without increasing reliability.

The Annotation Queue lets you easily annotate traces and supports quick, inline tagging as “Pass” or “Fail,” making it simple to mark whether an output is good enough. If needed, you can assign someone to handle the annotations, helping set up a repeatable QA process for [LLM integration](/blog/llm-integration).

Each review stays connected to the exact version of the function, the prompt, the inputs, and the model settings that were used. You can also include a reason for your decision and explain the criteria you applied; this helps others understand how you made your call, especially when judgment is involved.

![Lilypad Annotation Queue](/assets/blog/langfuse-alternatives/lilypad-annotation-queue.webp)

To keep things fair, Lilypad hides any existing annotations while you’re reviewing a trace so your opinion isn’t influenced.

In the codebase, you can label outputs on the spot (right after a function runs) by setting `mode="wrap"` in the `@lilypad.trace` decorator. When enabled, the function's return type is transformed into a `Traced[R]` object, which includes both the original return value and methods for interacting with the trace, like `.annotate()`:

```python
from google.genai import Client
import lilypad

client = Client()
lilypad.configure()

@lilypad.trace(name="Recommend Book", versioning="automatic", mode="wrap")  # [!code highlight]
def recommend_book(genre: str) -> str | None:
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=f"Recommend a good {genre} book.",
    )
    return response.text
    
trace: lilypad.Trace[str | None] = recommend_book("science fiction")  # [!code highlight]
print(trace.response)  # original response
# > You should read 'Dune' by Frank Herbert.

annotation = lilypad.Annotation(  # [!code highlight]
    label="pass",  # [!code highlight]
    reasoning="The recommendation fits the genre and is a well-known classic.",  # [!code highlight]
    data=None,  # [!code highlight]
    type=None,  # [!code highlight]
)  # [!code highlight]
trace.annotate(annotation)  # [!code highlight]
```

Evaluating outputs directly in the code means you don’t have to switch to the application UI, making it ideal for automated tests, scripted evaluations, integrating annotations into CI/CD workflows, or even enabling end users to annotate traces directly as they use your product.

Manual reviews are just the starting point, and as you build up a solid base of annotations, you can train an [LLM\-as-a-judge](/blog/llm-as-judge) to handle much of the labeling for you. This shifts your team’s role from tagging outputs to simply verifying them, which speeds up every [prompt evaluation](/blog/prompt-evaluation) while still keeping humans in the loop for accuracy and trust.

You’ll still want to spot-check the results, though. That way, you can catch mistakes, fine-tune the judge, and keep quality high. And the more consistently you annotate, whether in the UI or directly in code, the better. Each labeled example helps build a stronger dataset for comparing versions and spotting regressions over time, which allows you turn outputs into measurable progress.

### Track Every Prompt Like Code

Lilypad gives you full visibility into every LLM call: prompt, parameters, and outputs. Whether you're debugging, improving, or collaborating, you get structured, versioned records for your [LLM applications](/blog/llm-applications) of exactly what ran and why.

[Sign in with GitHub](https://lilypad.mirascope.com/) to explore the Lilypad for free, or [self-host](/docs/lilypad/getting-started/self-hosting) in minutes for local control.
