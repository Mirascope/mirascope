any reason without prior notice or liability.  We reserve the right to change, suspend,

## 10. <u className="pl-2">BINDING ARBITRATION</u>

In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Website,
or any other products or services provided by us (each, a "<u>Dispute</u>"), such dispute
will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA").  NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH
CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS
LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN
SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL
RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.  All disputes will be resolved before a
neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except
for a limited right of appeal under the FAA.  The arbitration shall be commenced and
conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where
appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All
applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website
[www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS
filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.  Judgment
on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause
shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from
a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The arbitration may be conducted in person,
through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the
arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside.  The parties
may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or
to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. 
The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all
non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information)
relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.  Nothing in
these Terms of Use will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.  

## 11. <u className="pl-2">CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u>

You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between
us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or
proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any
Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action
procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT
AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 

## 12. <u className="pl-2">EQUITABLE RELIEF</u>

You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our
intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we
will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to
enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement,
seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive
relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the
arbitration referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the
personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of
California for purposes of any such action by us. 

## 13. <u className="pl-2">CONTROLLING LAW; EXCLUSIVE FORUM</u>

The Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State
of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  For disputes not subject
to binding arbitration under Section 10, the parties hereby consent and agree to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of California,
for all suits, actions, or proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, and waive any and all objections to such courts, including but not limited
to, objections based on improper venue or inconvenient forum, and each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suits, actions,
or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

## 14. <u className="pl-2">MISCELLANEOUS</u>

If the Agreement is terminated in accordance with the termination provision in
"<u>Section 9</u>" above, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect: 
"Intellectual Property," "Feedback,""No Warranties; Limitation of Liability,"
"Indemnification," "Compliance with Applicable Laws," "Termination of the Agreement,"
"Binding Arbitration," "Class Action Waiver," "Controlling Law; Exclusive Forum," and
"Miscellaneous."

You may not assign any of your rights, duties, or obligations under these Terms of Use to
any person or entity, in whole or in part, without written consent from Mirascope. Our
failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.  No waiver shall be
effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a
waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  Except as expressly agreed by us and you in
writing, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect
to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether
written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter.  The section
headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. 
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and
sublicensees.
